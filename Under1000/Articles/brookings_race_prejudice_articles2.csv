1,Globalization Explained to the French,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/globalization-explained-to-the-french/,Philip H. Gordon,"The Affaire Danone—the recent panic in Paris set off by rumors that one of France’s top food companies was subject to a hostile takeover from PepsiCo—is but the most recent example of France’s particular resistance to economic globalization. From sheep farmer José Bové’s famous dismantling a McDonald’s restaurant in 1999 to the rejection last summer of the supposedly “neo-liberal” EU constitution, the French continue to demonstrate that they have an even tougher time than others in accepting the growing, and inexorable, integration of the world economy.

Another of France’s particularities is the tendency of its leaders to noisily denounce globalization while accepting the reality that they cannot stop it—and should not want to. For former Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, the practice consisted of criticizing “jungle capitalism” and promising to “tame” globalization while at the same time privatizing more of the French economy than the five preceding prime ministers put together. Similarly, President Jacques Chirac promises to “humanize” globalization and denounces the “ultra-liberal Anglo-Saxon economy” while the share of foreign stock and investment in the French stock market only increases under his leadership.

Today, it’s current Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin’s turn to maintain the French tradition of globalization by stealth. In the face of French worries about growing foreign investment in the French economy, Villepin has invented the reassuring concept of “economic patriotism,” all while taking some very useful steps to make the French labor market more flexible. The Prime Minister’s idea is that France must defend its “national champions,” as if in today’s world the idea of a truly “French” company still actually made any sense. The majority of Dannon employees, for example, work abroad, and the firm makes 70% of its profits from outside of France. Is this really a “French” company? Do its owners invest more in France than a foreign owner would, and are they doing it for patriotic reasons?

Why can’t French leaders be more frank with the French, and explain to them that to succeed in the 21st century, a modern economy must be open to the world? That cheap imported goods from the developing world reduce the cost of living in France and make French companies more competitive, which creates jobs in France? That an American investor who buys a French company does not do it to gobble up the “crown jewels” of France but because he or she hopes to make that company more profitable? That decades of economic history show that closed economies are the poorest, with little job creation, and thus the least capable of caring for their citizens, including those whose jobs are threatened by globalization?

It seems to me that there are three explanations for the French hostility toward globalization. The first is that globalization directly challenges the statist economic and political traditions of the country, which has by no means disappeared. Despite efforts over the past few years to reduce the role of the state in the economy, government spending continues to represent 54% of the French GDP, a much higher level than in most other industrialized nations.

A second reason is the very strong French attachment to their culture and their identity, which many in France believe is threatened by a globalization that takes the form of Americanization. Would the French have been as troubled by a takeover of Dannon if the buyer had been the Swiss firm Nestlé instead of Pepsico? The ghost of “coca-colonization” seems to bother the French as much as a new investor badly running one of its companies.

Finally, the French resist globalization because it threatens the notion of equality, which is one of the founding principles of the French republic. The inequalities created by globalization, which is more or less accepted by the more individualistic Americans, are not acceptable in a France that prefers equality—even at the cost of an elevated rate of unemployment and lower standard of living.

French leaders’ hesitation to accepting globalization is therefore quite understandable—but not necessarily any more wise. If Villepin’s economic patriotism is solely designed to reassure the left and French nationalists by protecting truly “strategic” industries while liberalizing the French economy so that it functions better, the concept is not bad. But the attempt to protect a yogurt maker suggests otherwise. If a French Dannon succeeds less well than a global Dannon, is it patriotic to protect it? If foreign investment better assured its success, is it “economic” to reject it?

L’affaire Danone, avec la récente panique provoquée par une rumeur selon laquelle la firme française serait la cible d’une OPA hostile de PepsiCo, n’est que la démonstration la plus récente de la réticence particulière de la France vis-à-vis de la mondialisation économique. José Bové, Attac, la taxe Tobin, les best-sellers de Viviane Forrester, le blocage aux frontières des textiles chinois ou encore le rejet massif de la Constitution européenne, dite trop «libérale», le 29 mai… Les Français ne cessent de fournir les preuves qu’ils ont encore plus de mal que d’autres à accepter l’intégration croissante et inexorable de l’économie mondiale. Autre particularité de la France : la tendance de ses dirigeants à dénoncer bruyamment la mondialisation tout en l’acceptant comme une réalité qu’ils ne peuvent pas arrêter, et n’ont d’ailleurs pas intérêt à arrêter. Pour Lionel Jospin, cela consistait à critiquer «le capitalisme de la jungle» et à promettre de «maîtriser la mondialisation», alors même qu’il privatisait plus que l’ensemble des cinq premiers ministres précédents. Jacques Chirac, lui, promet d’«humaniser la mondialisation», dénonce «l’économie anglo-saxonne ultralibérale» de la Constitution européenne, pendant que la part des échanges et la part des investissements étrangers dans le PNB français ne cessent de croître.

Aujourd’hui, c’est au tour de Dominique de Villepin de prolonger la tradition française de soutien furtif à la mondialisation. Face aux inquiétudes françaises devant les délocalisations et les interventions étrangères dans l’économie française, le premier ministre invente le concept rassurant de «patriotisme économique», tout en prenant les mesures qui s’imposent pour rendre le marché du travail plus flexible. L’idée du premier ministre est qu’il faut défendre des «champions nationaux», comme si, de nos jours, l’idée d’une compagnie vraiment «française» avait un sens. La majorité des employés de Danone, par exemple, travaille à l’étranger, et la firme réalise 70% de ses profits hors la France. Est-ce une firme «française» ? Ses patrons investissent-ils plus en France que ne le ferait un patron étranger, et le font-ils pour des raisons patriotiques ?

Pourquoi les dirigeants français ne peuvent-ils pas être plus francs – pour ne pas dire honnêtes – avec les Français, et leur expliquer que, pour réussir au XXIe siècle, une économie moderne doit être ouverte au monde ? Que les produits bon marché importés du monde en développement réduisent le coût de la vie en France et rendent les entreprises françaises plus compétitives, ce qui crée des emplois en France ? Qu’un investisseur américain qui achète une firme française ne le fait pas pour accaparer les «trésors nationaux» français mais parce qu’il espère la rendre plus rentable ? Pourquoi ne peuvent-ils pas leur expliquer, enfin, que des décennies d’histoire économique démontrent que les économies fermées sont les plus pauvres, les moins créatrices d’emplois et, partant, les moins capables de prendre soin de leurs citoyens, y compris de ceux dont les emplois sont menacés par la mondialisation ?

Il me semble qu’il y a au moins trois explications au refus français de la mondialisation. La première, c’est que la mondialisation menace directement la tradition politique et économique étatiste du pays – une tradition qui est loin d’avoir disparu. En dépit des efforts de ces dernières années visant à réduire le rôle de l’Etat dans l’économie, les dépenses du gouvernement continuent à représenter 54% du PNB français, un chiffre beaucoup plus élevé que celui de la plupart des pays industrialisés. La deuxième raison, c’est l’attachement particulier des Français à leur culture et à leur identité, que beaucoup estiment menacées par une mondialisation assimilée à l’américanisation. Les Français auraient-ils été aussi troublés par une OPA sur Danone si l’acheteur avait été le suisse Nestlé plutôt qu’une firme américaine ? C’est sans doute le spectre de la «Coca-colonisation» qui dérange les Français autant que la peur que de nouveaux investisseurs gèrent mal une de leurs entreprises.

Enfin, les Français résistent à la mondialisation parce qu’elle menace la notion d’égalité, qui est un des principes fondateurs de la République française. Les fortes inégalités qui sont créées par la mondialisation, plus ou moins acceptées par les Américains, plus individualistes, ne le sont pas dans une France qui semble préférer l’égalité même au prix d’un taux de chômage élevé et d’un niveau vie réduit.

L’hésitation des dirigeants français à accepter la mondialisation est donc bien compréhensible et conforme à la tradition du pays, ce qui ne la rend pas pour autant très salutaire. Si le patriotisme économique de Dominique de Villepin est uniquement destiné à rassurer la gauche et les souverainistes français en montrant qu’il protège des industries vraiment «stratégiques», tout en libéralisant l’économie française pour qu’elle fonctionne mieux, l’initiative est à applaudir. Mais la tentative de protéger un fabricant de yaourts ne semble pas illustrer une telle approche. Si un Danone «français» réussit moins bien qu’un Danone «global», est-il «patriotique» de le protéger ? Si des investissements étrangers assurent mieux sa réussite, est-il «économique» de les rejeter ? Ce dont la France a besoin, c’est d’une pédagogie de la mondialisation, et non d’un nouveau renforcement des préjugés des Français en la matière.

2,"The Rise of Sweden Democrats: Islam, Populism and the End of Swedish Exceptionalism",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-rise-of-sweden-democrats-and-the-end-of-swedish-exceptionalism/,Danielle Lee Tomson,"Historically, Sweden has been a generous safe haven for refugees. Of all the countries featured in this Brookings project, it has taken in the most refugees per capita, and is third in the world on this measure behind Canada and Australia.1 In 2015, Sweden had a record-high of 162,877 applications for asylum, primarily from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan—or about 1.6 percent of Sweden’s population of 10 million.2 This would be proportionally equivalent to over five million people applying for asylum in the United States, which in fact only received approximately 83,000 asylum applications that year.3

For a country like Sweden that has grown increasingly secular over recent decades, the influx of Muslims from war-torn countries has greatly impacted politics and society. The Sweden Democrats (Sverigedemokraterna), a right-wing populist party once politically verboten because of ties to neo-Nazis at its founding in 1988, is now the third largest party in the Riksdag, the Swedish parliament. It has effectively fashioned a narrative linking the surge of predominantly Muslim immigrants to a perception of an uptick in violent crimes and perceived strains on the prized Swedish welfare system. Swedes who are disgruntled by “the establishment” response to these concerns, especially regarding sociocultural issues,4 are attracted to the populist refrain of the Sweden Democrats: “We say what you think.”5 Unsurprisingly, the Sweden Democrats’ primary talking point is to specifically halt asylum immigration, which is predominantly Muslim.

This case study offers insight into why Swedes are joining the Sweden Democrats and the connection to their perception of Islam. Through interviews with Sweden Democrat voters and officials primarily in Skåne, the southern party stronghold, this paper provides an intimate portrait of Sweden Democrats and their frustration with a political establishment over Muslim immigration, the perceived impact on the welfare system, and the cultural fallout in secular, liberal Sweden.6 Interviewees eagerly shared their experiences of changes in Sweden, such as the introduction of Muslim children joining their kids’ classes, witnessing crimes in neighborhoods with more immigrants, and experiencing what they think of as religious concessions for Muslims who “should” be assimilating to secular Sweden.

Sweden Democrats do not believe that problems of crime or integration stem primarily from failures of socioeconomic policy or government bureaucracy; rather, they also blame culture, both of Muslim immigrants and political correctness. The Sweden Democrats and their robust network of “alternative media”7 offer narratives that make sense of these phenomena, regardless of whether claims might be unverified or false. When faced with allegations of racism, however, Sweden Democrats double down on the populist message that they are normal, working-class people trying to call attention to socioeconomic and sociocultural challenges posed by an influx of non-Western refugees, which they claim traditional political parties do not tackle head-on.

To understand the rise of the Sweden Democrats, it is important to first consider how the party exists in opposition to Sweden’s pre-existing political landscape, which had been governed more or less by a centrist consensus emphasizing humanitarianism and social welfare. The current ruling party, the Social Democrats, has been in power for the better part of the twentieth century with the exception of a few election cycles. Under the idea of folkhemmet or creating a “people’s home,” the Social Democrats in the 1930s were responsible for setting up much of Sweden’s robust social welfare system. It is the oldest party in Sweden and is currently leading the government in coalition with the Green Party.8

The second largest party is the Moderates, a center-right party and the main opposition to the Social Democrats. They differ from the latter in their support for free market principles, economic liberalism, and tax cuts. From 2006 to 2014 they were the lead party in coalition with the Christian Democrats, Liberals, and Center Party. Yet when the Sweden Democrats became the Riksdag’s third largest party in 2018, this coalition split, with the Liberals and Center Party offering support to the Social Democrats and refusing to make common cause with the Sweden Democrats to form a conservative government.9

There is a proud national narrative of “Swedish Exceptionalism” for welcoming refugees and providing asylum. While Swedes might have guarded their ethnic homogeneity before the 1930s, by World War II, Sweden began accepting Norwegian, Jewish, Danish, and Estonian immigrants.10 In the decades following, they welcomed Iranians after the Islamic revolution, Chileans fleeing Pinochet, and war refugees from the former Yugoslavia. Being a safe haven for others became a point of pride.11 As other European countries moved toward stricter immigration policies in the 1990s and 2000s, Sweden opened up.12 With some exceptions, politicians on both the left and right supported generous asylum and immigration policies well above the EU-minimum standards.13

All of this changed with the refugee crisis of 2015, marking the “end of Swedish exceptionalism,” when political parties changed their rhetoric and policies in reaction to fears of a “system collapse” from the massive influx of migrants.14 By November 2015, even the Social Democrat Prime Minister Stefan Löfven noted, “It pains me that Sweden is no longer capable of receiving asylum seekers at the high level we do today. We simply cannot do any more,” the near opposite of what he said just seven months before.15 By this time however, the Sweden Democrats had already seized the opportunity to position themselves as the only “authentic” party calling for curbing immigration not just recently but for decades.

It was against a backdrop of de-industrialization, public spending cutbacks, rising unemployment, and the violent breakup of Yugoslavia that caused an influx of refugees, that the Swedish Democrats grew up after their founding in 1988.16 Like other radical right parties, they called for restricting immigration across the board, not just of Muslims.17 Initially, the party had connections to Swedish fascism and explicit white nationalism.18 They elected Anders Klarström as party chairman in 1989, who had been linked to the neo-Nazi Nordic Realm Party.19 After photos surfaced of some members wearing Nazi uniforms in the mid-1990s, the party banned the wearing of uniforms of any kind and explicitly denounced Nazism in an attempt to present a more respectable image.20

Most of my interviewees acknowledged the racist origins of the Sweden Democrats but insisted that the party had outgrown them. A party official and Iranian immigrant who joined in 2013 rejected claims of racism, despite his own initial fears to the contrary: “I was afraid that when I became a member, when I was coming to party headquarters in Malmö, I was expecting like, oh, will there be a Southern Dixie Flag. But I came here and there was coffee and cookies and there was nothing like that.”21 Other respondents claimed that while extremists still sometimes showed up to local Sweden Democrat meetings, they were summarily expelled. A few interviewees shrugged off the party’s past or denied pieces of it, saying that political adversaries draw attention to the racist past to delegitimize the party.

Despite dark origins, the Sweden Democrats have surged both in Riksdag seats and in public opinion polls. In the 2018 Riksdag election, the Sweden Democrats gained 13 seats for a total of 62, while the Social Democrats lost 13 seats, dropping to 100.22 Since 2014, the Sweden Democrats have been the third largest party in parliament.23 Particularly in the southern Skäne region, Sweden Democrats have made up the largest party in 21 of the region’s 33 municipalities since 2018.24 During the writing of this paper, the Sweden Democrats tailed the Social Democrats as most popular among voters in opinion polls, at one point besting them with 24 percent of support, compared to the Social Democrats at 22 percent.25

Why the increased popularity? Scholars Anders Hellström, Tom Nilsson, and Pauline Stoltz describe three phases of the Sweden Democrats’ development. The first was before 2006, when the party was more or less out of public view and perceived as a small movement with neo-Nazi flourishes. In 2005, the 26-year-old chairman of the Sweden Democratic Youth, Jimmie Åkesson became the party leader, a position he still holds today. A former web developer and ex-Moderate, Åkesson strove to change the party’s image after various neo-Nazi leaders were expelled.26 The change in leadership arguably ushered the party into a second stage (2006-2010), pushing it away from openly racist groups and toward a populist message advocating for “ordinary people” against a corrupt elite at the height of a global recession. This catapulted the Swedish Democrats into the media and public consciousness and gave the party its first significant electoral gains. The third phase came in 2010, when they entered parliament for the first time with 20 seats.27 The party officially changed its self description from “nationalist” to “social conservative” in 2011, and in 2012 introduced a “zero tolerance for racism” policy, which expelled party members with public opinions deemed as too racist.28

Notably, anti-Islam and anti-Muslim sentiments were not included in this expulsion. The Sweden Democrats had been laying the groundwork for a more focused anti-Islam narrative long before 2015, identifying Islam as public enemy number one. Åkesson claimed in 2009, “As a Sweden Democrat I see this [Islam and Muslims in Sweden] as our biggest foreign threat since World War II…Leading representatives of the Muslim community will demand the implementation of Sharia law in Sweden; that the Swedish municipal health board would use taxes to circumcise totally healthy young boys; that Sweden would have a higher level of rape and that Muslim men would be strongly represented among the rapists; that Swedish swimming clubs would introduce separate timetables for women and men.”29

These warnings about Islam from Åkesson’s 2009 speech, such as rape by migrants and religiously segregated swimming pools, came up in many interviews, despite most interviewees only joining the party in the past five to seven years. Survey research shows that Sweden Democrats have significantly different opinions of Muslims than those in other parties. According to recent Pew Research Center polls, 59 percent of Swedes with a positive opinion of the Sweden Democrats express an unfavorable opinion of Muslims in their country. Conversely of those with a negative view of the Sweden Democrats, just 17 percent see Muslims negatively.30 Of Swedes, 70 percent had favorable attitudes toward immigration in 2015, yet Sweden Democrats’ higher skepticism toward immigration has framed it as an increasingly important political issue.31

Building on Hellstöm, Nilsson, and Stoltz, I suggest there is a fourth phase in the party’s evolution, marked by the 2015 refugee crisis. In a span of three months, 114,000 predominantly Muslim asylum seekers arrived in Sweden, primarily into Malmö and small towns in the South, overwhelming the capacity of both government and civil society organizations while garnering continuous media attention.32","March 25, 2020",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
3,Will Obama’s Agenda Pass Congress’s Budget Resolution?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/will-obamas-agenda-pass-congresss-budget-resolution/,William A. Galston,"Although the Senate Budget Committee has not yet finished marking up its version of the fiscal year 2010 budget resolution, the contour of congressional Democrats’ response to President Obama’s initial submission is already coming into view. Simply put: while they support most of the president’s priorities, they are poised to sideline many of the programs he proposed to implement those priorities. And the administration’s response to Congress is becoming clear as well: it will take whatever Congress produces and declare victory.

Still, the budget resolution that emerges from this process is likely to diverge from the president’s desires more than either Congress or the administration is willing to acknowledge. There are two principal reasons for this early display of congressional independence. First, some of the president’s proposals sparked disagreements among Democrats. Second, the Congressional Budget Office’s analysis of the president’s budget, projecting deficits of $9.3 trillion over the next decade, created sticker shock and forced congressional leaders to look for changes that could be represented as reducing the deficit.

To be sure, none of these reverses prevents President Obama from pressing ahead on these priorities through the regular legislative process. The chair of the Senate Budget Committee, Kent Conrad, emphasized this point. “We have not prejudged a legislative outcome,” he said. “We have made it possible for the committees of jurisdiction to do what the president is asking for on climate change, to do what he is asking for on health care, on energy, and education, but all of them would have to be offset”—that is, financed in a way that would not add to the budget deficit.

Because of sharp partisan polarization, the contemporary House of Representatives functions as a quasi-parliamentary body in which the dominant party can use majoritarian procedures to get its way. The real action is in the Senate, where opportunities to restrict debate are far more limited and where minority of 41 senators can prevent final legislative action. The majority has two choices: either it reaches out to the opposition to forge a super-majority, or it tries to use a special budgetary procedure known as reconciliation to get its way with as few as 51 votes.

This is where differences between the House and Senate approaches to the FY 2010 budget may prove crucial. The House version of the budget resolution authorizes the use of reconciliation procedures to expedite consideration of several administration initiatives, including comprehensive health reform. But Senator Conrad strongly disagrees. “I don’t believe reconciliation was ever intended for this purpose,” he said. “It doesn’t work well for writing major substantive legislation.” On the other hand, Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, reportedly favors keeping reconciliation open as an option. Max Baucus, the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, is reluctant to abandon a bipartisan approach, especially on health care.

Even if the final budget resolution includes language authorizing reconciliation, it remains an open question whether the bills produced under this rubric can be included in a so-called omnibus budget reconciliation act that can be passed with a simple majority. Since the mid-1980s, the “Byrd rule” (named for its author, Sen. Robert Byrd [D-WV]) has allowed any senator to challenge the relevance of any matter to the overall purpose of the reconciliation bill. Once such a challenge has been raised, it takes a three-fifths vote of the members (60 if the full body participates) to retain that matter in the bill. It is entirely possible, then, that measures crafted by the Democratic majority could be challenged during the reconciliation process and stripped from the bill—that is, unless some Republicans stepped forward to provide the additional votes needed to retain it.

Surviving a challenge is not easy. During the first two decades the Byrd rule was in effect, 55 challenges occurred, and 42 of them succeeded in removing the contested matter from the omnibus bill. Conventional wisdom is in fact correct: more often than not, large legislative changes require some measure of cooperation across party lines. (28 House Democrats and 10 Senate Democrats voted for final passage of the 2001 Bush tax cuts.) Before Democrats decide to bypass the compromises that bipartisan cooperation requires, they should at least consider the lessons of recent history.","March 26, 2009",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
4,Beyond Sushiology: Does Diversity Work?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/beyond-sushiology-does-diversity-work/,Peter Skerry,"If your friends and colleagues are like mine, they tend to orient their domestic travel plans around cherished ethnic restaurants. So do I. But many carry their enthusiasm a step further, seeing the extraordinary variety and quality of ethnic cuisine now available in the United States as evidence of the unalloyed benefits flowing from our racial and ethnic diversity. I call this syndrome “sushiology.”

For a more nuanced view of the profound demographic changes sweeping the United States, talk to a priest in a typical Catholic parish in southern California. The priest might, like the rest of us, wax poetic about his favorite local ethnic restaurants. But he will also note the daunting problems of, say, putting on Sunday mass for parishioners who speak English, Spanish, Vietnamese, and Tagalog. Should there be a separate mass in each language? Or should masses be multilingual, with different parts in various languages? Whichever he chooses, someone will feel neglected. And in any case, he must find priests with the needed language skills.

Language is only the most obvious problem introduced by diversity. In a small town in Iowa large numbers of new Latino immigrants create resentment among long-time Anglo parishioners when they bring little children to church and let them roam about during services. Such resentments are typically attributed to Anglo “insensitivity” or “racism.” But as the Wall Street Journal recently reported, intense animosities have flared between newly arrived Mexicans and more established Puerto Ricans and Dominicans in a predominantly Latino parish in the Bronx. No wonder the Hispanic Jesuit Alan Figueroa-Deck, writing in the liberal Catholic magazine America, criticizes the hierarchy’s “ideology of multiculturalism” and points to the remarkable success of Evangelical and Pentecostal Protestants in building ethnically homogeneous congregations among Latinos. Clearly, diversity’s beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

Does diversity work? And how well? Surprisingly, neither question gets much attention. The benefits and costs of diversity have yet to be adequately evaluated in light of specific problems or objectives. In this brief space I will move beyond the anecdotal evidence?beyond sushiology?and review some findings of social scientists who have systematically examined the consequences of racial and ethnic diversity. Not surprisingly, these findings conflict. But at the very least, they show the sushiologists’ view to be wildly optimistic. A more sober perspective is needed, one that remembers what political and social thinkers have long understood: that diversity is typically associated with dissent and conflict. Why is this downside of diversity so consistently overlooked?

Let’s look again at ethnic restaurants. What does it mean to patronize such establishments? Analytically, it means engaging in a market exchange relationship where the negative externalities sometimes associated with immigration are minimized, ignored, or reversed. For example, a language barrier, inconvenient in other contexts, is part of the ambience diners enjoy in a restaurant. And if they don’t like the food, they can take their business elsewhere. They can also focus on those dishes that please their palates, such as chicken mole, and avoid those that do not, such as menudo, the pungent soup that Mexicans make from bovine entrails.

So visits to ethnic restaurants feature a high degree of consumer sovereignty. Indeed, the public accommodation provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act offer customers complete freedom of choice among eateries, while giving proprietors practically no choice about whom they may serve. Surely this is one reason why Americans enjoy ethnic restaurants so much and why diversity enthusiasts cite them so frequently. But the imbalance built into such relationships makes them atypical, a poor basis for generalizations about the costs and benefits of diversity.

What about diversity in other realms? Immigration, for instance? There the discussion, at least among social analysts, begins to take into account both costs and benefits. While sushiologists enthusiastically invoke diversity in their defense of currently high levels of immigration, economist George Borjas criticizes that same policy by noting that it lacks diversity. Pointing out that today’s influx is much more ethnically homogeneous than that a century ago, Borjas argues that greater diversity in the national-origin mix of the current immigrant stream is needed to retard the development of isolated ethnic enclaves. He concludes: “Ironically, ‘diversity pays’ in a sense that is at complete odds with what is typically implied by those who favor multiculturalism.”

Economist Edward Lazear advances a different rationale for diversity. He suggests that a more ethnically varied immigrant stream would make Americans more productive by introducing new modes of thinking and more efficient ways of delivering goods and services. In a related vein, political scientist James Scott makes a case for social diversity: “Like the diverse old-growth forest, a richly differentiated neighborhood with many kinds of shops, entertainment centers, services, housing options, and public spaces is, virtually by definition, a more resilient and durable neighborhood. Economically, the diversity of its commercial ‘bets’ (everything from funeral parlors and public services to grocery stores and bars) makes it less vulnerable to economic downturns. At the same time its diversity provides many opportunities for economic growth in upturns.”

As Scott acknowledges, he draws heavily on the work of urban analyst Jane Jacobs. And while neither Scott nor Jacobs is concerned specifically with race or ethnicity, this dimension of social diversity is clearly implicit in their analyses. More to the point, neither Scott nor Jacobs focuses narrowly on the economic benefits of diversity. Both argue that diversity sustains the informal relations on which the formal institutions of modern societies critically depend for social order.

Yet Jacobs’s insight can lead to quite different conclusions. Her work has been relied on by social scientists developing innovative approaches to law enforcement, such as community policing. And here, diversity appears less rosy. Writes Wesley Skogan: “Equitable Community Policing efforts may only be possible when there is a degree of homogeneity and consensus that does not exist in many troubled neighborhoods?. One of the greatest problems is that it is difficult to organize low-income, heterogeneous, deteriorating, high-turnover, disorderly neighborhoods. For community organizers, the American context of diversity is a fundamental part of the problems they face.”

This skepticism is echoed by criminologists Jerome Skolnick and David Bayley, who observe: “Police-community reciprocity can be achieved only where there is a genuine bonding of interests between the police and the served citizenry, on the one hand, and among definable sections of the public, on the other. That may turn out to be progressively difficult to accomplish in demographically complex urban areas, with their increasingly ethnic diversity.”

Other analysts note the deleterious impact of racial and ethnic diversity on working-class cohesion and social democratic movements. Comments political scientist Gary Freeman: “Weak labor movements are generally found in those countries that are ethnically heterogeneous. The most notable example is, of course, the United States, where racial divisions have historically vitiated the efforts of the labor movement to push for social reform. By making racially diverse societies out of previously homogeneous ones, migration has complicated social and political cleavages.”

Equally suggestive is the body of research produced by social psychologists and organizational behavioralists, some drawing on small-group research in laboratory settings, others on field analysis of natural settings. Strikingly, few of these studies focus on racial and ethnic diversity?as opposed to age, gender, or occupational diversity. One possible explanation was unexpectedly highlighted in a survey of more than 500 employees at the international headquarters of a major household goods moving firm. Survey researchers were permitted to collect data on a variety of employee characteristics?but not on ethnic background and nationality.

A consistent finding of research is that racial and ethnic diversity can generate more creative and innovative ideas?but that it is also linked with conflict, especially emotional conflict among co-workers. In a nutshell, diversity appears to produce both positive outcomes and obstacles to implementing those outcomes. To be sure, racial and ethnic diversity is not the only source of conflict in such settings. Age similarity, for instance, can foster intense competition among peer rivals, which can undermine organizational cohesion. Nevertheless, racial and ethnic diversity appears to be a salient source of dissension and conflict.

Not surprisingly, the proportions of racial and ethnic minorities affect these outcomes in complicated ways. The effect of a single minority individual on group dynamics, whether social interactions or task performance, will differ from that of several. Then, too, not all sources of racial and ethnic diversity are equivalent. There is evidence that Asians and whites work together better than blacks and whites. There is also evidence that culturally diverse groups perform better on lengthy and complex tasks than on simpler, quick-turn-around assignments.

Explanations of these dynamics vary. Again, the most obvious and mundane is language. In the dry formulation of one study of multinational military forces: “Cultural heterogeneity may contribute to the emergence of coordination and communication problems.” More sophisticated explanations rely on “social categorization theory,” which posits the familiar tendency of individuals to be drawn to those like themselves and to create in-groups and out-groups. It is precisely this dynamic that results in racial and ethnic conflict within organizations. Yet social categorization theory also suggests the possibility of creating broadly inclusive common identities and goals that would subsume racial and ethnic identities and moderate such conflicts.

Thus, while most researchers find an association between racial and ethnic diversity and conflict, they also hold out hope that the conflict can be managed and even overcome?in other words, that the benefits of diversity can be made to outweigh the costs. At the end of their careful review of 40 years of research on diversity (including racial and ethnic) in organizations, psychologists Katherine Williams and Charles O’Reilly conclude: “The preponderance of empirical evidence suggests that diversity is most likely to impede group functioning. Unless steps are taken to actively counteract these effects?by itself, diversity is more likely to have negative than positive effects on group performance? In our view, these conclusions suggest that diversity is a mixed blessing and requires careful and sustained attention to be a positive force in enhancing performance.”

Needless to say, getting to where the benefits of racial and ethnic diversity outweigh the costs can be a tall order. Precisely because diversity is a mixed blessing, it is difficult to muster the careful and sustained attention needed to make it work?especially in a highly individualistic and competitive society, where the organizational or governmental capacity to sustain such focus is always in short supply. Not surprisingly, advocates, especially those concerned with “diversity management,” tend to downplay or even deny the fundamental tensions and conflicts engendered by diversity.

A case in point is University of Michigan psychologist Patricia Gurin, whose research on diversity in higher education was submitted as part of a recent, widely publicized federal suit over Michigan’s affirmative action undergraduate admission program. (As of this writing, the policy remains in place, pending final determination by a federal appeals court.) Without engaging either the methodological disputes surrounding Gurin’s research or the substantive disagreements over her support for affirmative action, I would suggest that Gurin’s work exemplifies the pervasive but little noted tendency to downplay the costs of diversity.

Gurin’s argument in favor of racial and ethnic diversity on campus draws on the work of Erik Erikson, Jean Piaget, and other developmental psychologists, who hold that the emotional and intellectual development of young adults depends critically on being confronted by discontinuities and discrepancies with their own family backgrounds. While Gurin acknowledges that Erikson was not making an explicit case for social diversity, she strenuously maintains that his arguments “provide a strong theoretical rationale for the importance of bringing students from varied backgrounds together to create a diverse and complex learning environment.”

Such insights have become conventional wisdom, especially among the middle and upper-middle classes. No surprises here. What is noteworthy about Gurin’s analysis is her effort to secure the benefits of racial and ethnic diversity without incurring the costs. To be sure, she explicitly bases her theoretical perspective on the assumption that diversity leads to conflict and that “it is discourse over conflict, not unanimity, that helps democracy thrive,” buttressing the point with references to Aristotle.

Yet when Gurin moves beyond theory to address the specific implications of diversity at universities, her celebration of diversity-induced conflict gets downplayed, even disappears. She writes: “Institutions with diverse student bodies must be attentive to creating conditions that diminish competition among groups and value the diversity that students bring to the classroom as an important part of making the most of learning that can occur in diverse classrooms.” Gurin goes on to gently chide race relations researcher Hubert Blalock for not addressing how to diminish racial conflict: “Blalock theorizes that as the number of minority individuals increases, the greater the likelihood that there will be conflict and competition with members of the majority. He does not theorize, however, how conflict can be minimized under conditions where increased diversity is inevitable. Educational institutions have the potential to minimize conflict.”

Gurin is hardly alone in trying to have it both ways. Many of us avoid facing up to the full implications of diversity. Historian John Higham traces this aversion to the romanticism that underlies contemporary pluralism. Today’s celebration of diversity, he notes, began more than a century ago with writers like William James, who “depended on an unstated assumption that a natural harmony underlies the conflicts and discords of life? In an essentially friendly universe the parts can be true to their separate characters. Purposes can clash without rending.”

So, when diversity leads, as it usually does, to competition and conflict, we explain them away as the result either of irrational prejudice or of politics. The latter explanation is especially tempting, given our Lockean bent for limited government. Moreover, because of our tragic and violent racial history, in which the competition was so unfairly rigged against African Americans and other minorities, we are uneasy with intergroup conflict and prone to high-minded moralism?which seemingly permits us to transcend both racial discord and political strife. Then, too, as British philosopher Stuart Hampshire suggests, our aversion to conflict may also be traced to our Enlightenment faith in the power of reason to resolve fundamental human problems.

But as Hampshire and his fellow Briton, Bernard Crick, both emphasize (from very different perspectives), the purpose of politics is to cope with the conflicts that inevitably arise from the diverse interests that comprise any society. Hampshire makes the point with blunt eloquence: “Justice is conflict.” Perhaps, then, our tolerance for diversity needs to be counterbalanced by tolerance for the conflict that typically follows.

In a polyglot country such as ours, it may be tempting to exalt diversity?but not to the point of overlooking the real challenges and costs that it entails. Diversity can work, but making it work is a messy, contentious business. Reveling in the joys of ethnic cuisine is definitely inadequate to the task at hand. We need to recognize that diversity is no free lunch.","December 1, 2002",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
5,Affirmative Action: Opening up workplace networks to Afro-Americans,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/affirmative-action-opening-up-workplace-networks-to-afro-americans/,Orlando Patterson,"In the workplace, as in many aspects of their lives, Afro-Americans as a group are systematically unconnected to the essential network resources that most other Americans take for granted. Their workplace isolation involves far more than the impenetrable “glass ceilings” associated with the nation’s boardrooms. It is pervasive, hampering working-class laborers seeking well-paying jobs on a construction work crew just as it does upwardly mobile college graduates.

This isolation can be addressed, but only partially, by access to improved educational opportunities. Such opportunities might be able to compensate for network deficiencies in the long run, mainly through introducing Afro-American students to other students with wider network ranges, but the process is painfully slow. For a group as unconnected as Afro-Americans, it may take multiple generations. Speeding up this process requires affirmative action.

The fundamental insight of network sociologists is that characteristics of a person’s network of ties to others structure the flow of information that both socializes him as he grows up and provides social resources critical for competent functioning as an adult. Economic behavior in particular, as noted by Mark Granovetter in Getting a Job, is “heavily embedded in other social processes that closely constrain and determine its course and results.” Without denying the importance of individual attributes in accounting for success, network sociologists nevertheless consider past and present structures of network ties and their attendant information flows to be of at least equal importance in explaining a person’s achievements. As sociologists Nan Lin, Walter Ensel, and John Vaughn explain, the network approach “challenges the assumption that the labor market is essentially an open and competitive arena where specifications for a job and the necessary skills and competence are easily matched and where information about job and applicant availability is widely diffused.”

Karen Campbell, Peter Marsden, and Jeanne Hurlbert have demonstrated that networks operate as crucial resources for individuals in three ways. First, they help them to find a job, a home, or even a spouse. Second, they provide access to influential people. And, finally, they promote bargaining skills that enlarge the range and influence of networks even more. As Granovetter notes, “..careers are not made up of random jumps from one job to another, but rather…individuals rely on contacts acquired at various stages of their work-life and before. One important result of this is that mobility appears to be self-generating: the more different social and work settings one moves through, the larger the reservoir of personal contacts he has who may mediate further mobility.”

No ethnic group has ever achieved success in America by relying solely on education. Instead, immigrants—even ethnic groups that have powerful religious and social sanctions against such inter-ethnic bonding—have been able to make inroads into established American networks. Welcomed to the neighborhoods, clubs, and churches of existing groups, newcomers have quickly been able to develop the ties that extend their network ranges, especially in job searches and in getting credit for mortgages and small businesses.

Ethnic intermarriages have also contributed to immigrants’ success, both by extending their range of network ties and by involving them in new dense networks of strong affinal ties. Intermarriage enhances network bargaining skills in two ways: it encourages creative thinking about networking (imagine a Jewish groom’s first Sunday dinner with his Italian wife’s family), and it teaches traditions of network bargaining peculiar to the spouse’s ethnic group. More broadly, intermarriage encourages cultural and intellectual innovation. The explosive growth of artistic, scientific, technical, and entrepreneurial innovations in the United States is certainly linked to the high rate of intermarriage of its ethnic groups.

Afro-Americans, however, have been almost completely isolated from this national process. They are, for example, residentially isolated (see tables 1 and 2). As Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton, authors of American Apartheid, note of the data in table 1, “The isolation indices reveal the full extent of black racial seclusion within U.S. metropolitan areas, both northern and southern. The average value changed little over the decade and remained close to 66% in both regions; and in 1980 no metropolitan area displayed an isolation index under 50%. Despite the legal banning of discrimination and the apparent easing of white racial hostility, blacks and whites were still very unlikely to share a neighborhood within most metropolitan areas. In many cases, the degree of black spatial isolation was extreme.” There are, to be sure, some positive signs. Table 2 indicates modest recent improvement in some cities. And a surprising level of interracial contact, mainly originating at work, has been reported in polls despite the continued spatial segregation. Even so, it is astonishing that after living almost three centuries in this country, Afro-Americans have remained so spatially isolated.

Partly related to the group’s spatial segregation is its marital isolation. The intermarriage rates of Afro-Americans with non-Afro-Americans are far lower than those of other ethnic groups. Researchers often express the extent of intermarriage in terms of the proportion of women in a given group who marry men from other groups. But that measure is misleading because it fails to take account of compositional factors such as the relative sizes of the groups involved. A much better approach, that taken by Stanley Lieberson and Mary Waters in From Many Strands, is to measure intermarriage in terms of the rate that would be expected if spouses were chosen randomly in the population. Column 1 of table 3 shows that Afro-American women have by far the highest in-marriage rate of all ethnic groups. But this figure grossly underestimates the true level of isolation by not taking account of the proportion of all Americans who are Afro-American. Column 2, the proportion of husbands of each ethnic group in the population as a whole, is the proportion of such husbands we would expect to find in each ethnic group under conditions of random marital choice. The proportion of Afro-American husbands in the population as a whole, 7.4 percent, is what the in-marriage rate of Afro-American women would be if marital choices were random. Column 3 shows the ratio of in- to out-marriages (for Afro-American women, 74.4). Here we begin to see the true extent of Afro-American marital isolation. Column 4, the ratio of husbands within each group to husbands outside the group for all women outside the group, indicates that the ratio of Afro-American husbands to non-Afro-American husbands for all non-Afro-American women is .002. Column 5—the odds ratio derived from the ratios of Afro-American to non-Afro-American women’s marital choices—is the best measure of Afro-American marital isolation. It tells us, quite simply, that the odds that an Afro-American woman will marry an Afro-American man are 32,998 times greater than that a non-Afro-American woman will marry an Afro-American man! Compare this ratio with the odds ratios of other ethnic groups.

Further evidence on Afro-American isolation comes from sociological studies of Americans “core” networks—those people with whom they discuss “important matters.” The 1985 General Social Survey—the first nationwide sample of core network data—found striking racial and ethnic homogeneity in these networks. (The enormous liability of Afro-American marital isolation becomes even clearer when we learn that the typical American core network is small and centered on kin.) Significant variations, however, exist across subgroups. Not surprisingly, whites have the largest networks, Afro-Americans the smallest. One troubling finding of this and other studies is that, contrary to the identity rhetoric of Afro-American leaders and the claims of many sociologists, Afro-Americans do not compensate for their isolation from other groups by relying more heavily on kinsmen. To the contrary, as Peter Marsden, a preeminent network scholar, notes, “black respondents cited fewer kin and fewer non-kin than whites did, and their networks have a lower proportion of kin than those of whites.”

Affirmative action can best be seen as a medium-term strategy to supplement and expedite the long-term educational solution to the unfair isolation of Afro-Americans. It directly addresses and compensates for their network liability by inserting them into the network-rich educational institutions of the nation and the self-generating career networks at the workplace—networks that Euro-Americans take for granted.

Affirmative action in the educational sector builds networks in several ways. First, it helps youngsters gain skills. Defenders of affirmative action usually emphasize this role, but such a strategy cannot justify why students from disadvantaged backgrounds should be at the nation’s elite colleges if adequate educational alternatives exist for them that are congruent with their educational records. Indeed, as a bigger fish in a smaller pond, a talented Afro-American student may well acquire more purely technical skills at a good state institution than at Harvard.

But while educators are loath to admit it, elite educational institutions serve two primary functions: to recruit and educate the nation’s elite and to provide an environment in which students initiate and extend elite networks and learn network negotiating skills. Living and learning with students from elite environments helps establish wide-ranging links with elite networks, as well as dense links through intermarriages.

Given what we now know about the true nature of labor markets, it should be clear that only some form of affirmative action could have inserted Afro-Americans into the more working- and middle-class jobs on a significant scale. Economists often express bewilderment at the failure of Afro-Americans’ qualifications to match up with their earnings. That a Euro-American construction worker with a high school degree earns more than the typical Afro-American college graduate must be a source of endless disciplinary frustration for those who believe that the price system should match up workers of equal qualifications with jobs paying equal wages. As readers of this essay will know, however, there is an answer to this puzzle: networks.

Mark Granovetter’s description of the utility of networks in Getting a Job provides an excellent rationale for affirmative action intervention in the labor market: “Especially important to recognize, moreover, is the self-maintaining aspect of personal contact systems. Blacks are at a disadvantage in using channels of job information not because they have failed to ?develop an informal structure’ suitable to the need, but because they are presently under-represented in the structure of employment itself. If those presently employed in a given industry or firm have no black friends, no blacks will enter those settings through personal contacts. Once a core of blacks (or whatever group in question) has become established, however, a multiplier effect can be anticipated, as they recruit friends and relatives, who do the same, and so on. Once achieved, this situation is self-sustaining.” Since Granovetter wrote this in 1974, a great deal has been achieved, thanks in good part to precisely this effect of affirmative action. And, in fact, Granovetter offers not only a rationale for affirmative action but a way of judging where and when it has fulfilled its purpose. Affirmative action can and perhaps should be discontinued in any firm that has achieved this self-sustaining recruitment process for minority workers. The self-sustaining group, I would add, need not coincide with the proportion of the disadvantaged group in the population at large.

Another important area of economic justice that can be remedied only by affirmative action pertains to the role of networks in both the internal and external structure of organizations—particularly in middle- and upper-level employment decisions. Organizations, including business firms, rely heavily on informal networks both for the internal structuring of information and decisionmaking and for links with related organizations. At all levels there is not only a tacit culture at play—knowledge of how things really work as distinct from what the job descriptions and work manuals say—but vital network contacts to be made and important network negotiating skills to be learned if one is to effectively mobilize critical network figures and links within and between organizations. Minorities and women are often unconnected to such knowledge and links and may never stand a chance of acquiring them—because they are made, nurtured, and extended precisely in those places where disadvantaged minorities and women are not to be found.

This problem is commonly mentioned, so there is no need to belabor it except to note one important point. The higher up a hierarchy one goes, the more important network factors become in recruitment decisions. An unprejudiced personnel officer bound by a color- or gender-blind code, but alert to the organizational need for persons with the right network skills, will always be obliged to reject applicants from backgrounds with impoverished network resources. The costs are simply too high to train such people. Where then are these skills to be acquired? They can come only from organizations being pressured or provided with governmental incentives to train people in these skills until a critical mass of them exists.

All social policies incur costs, and affirmative action is no exception. The costs to individual Euro-Americans have been so thoroughly discussed that there is no need to repeat them here. One way to minimize the costs is to recognize three basic principles emerging from court decisions as identified by Jim D. Newman in 1989. The first is that the right to retain one s job is sacrosanct and cannot be interfered with by affirmative action under any circumstances. The program is best used in recruiting new workers. Thus, one may recruit an equally qualified Afro-American teacher over a Euro-American one on affirmative action grounds but not fire a Euro-American teacher instead of an Afro-American one for this reason. Second, while affirmative action is still needed in promotion decisions, ethnic or gender considerations can come into play only where candidates are otherwise equally qualified. Finally, quotas of any kind are prohibited.

Another important consideration concerns the nature of jobs. It might be helpful, for example, to distinguish between knowledge-intensive and network-intensive jobs. A network-intensive job is one for which employers depend heavily on informal contacts when filling vacancies; it also requires a great deal of network negotiating skill for its performance. A knowledge-intensive job is one where purely technical or cognitive qualifications dominate the recruitment and performance processes. Now, barring sinecures in city halls and family firms around the country, nearly all jobs that are network-intensive also require a minimum level of skills. But many jobs are almost wholly knowledge-intensive. I propose that affirmative action programs exclude such jobs and focus on network-intensive jobs—precisely those that can never be attained through schooling alone. These jobs, incidentally, are to be found at all levels of the occupational hierarchy.

Costs and responsibilities must also be borne by beneficiaries of affirmative action. One danger is that affirmative action may reduce the incentive for beneficiaries to perform at their very best. This troublesome possibility is suggested, for example, by the tendency for Afro-American students to perform below the level predicted by their test scores. I do not know whether the same problem exists at the workplace. One way of addressing or preventing an underachievement problem is for teachers and supervisors to evaluate with scrupulous honesty. Colleges should return to blind grading, and rules should be enacted that forbid all students from revealing their ethnic identities in their examination answers and papers.

The greatest risk of affirmative action is that it might become an institutionalized entitlement program. I strongly suspect that many otherwise sympathetic persons oppose it for precisely this reason. It is not an unreasonable apprehension, given the chronic propensity of government programs to become permanent. I will return to this in my final suggestion.

A related, and equally disturbing, danger is that some Afro-American leaders may conspire with segregationist Euro-Americans to stand affirmative action on its head. As this article has made clear, the main justification for affirmative action is that it compensates for the liability of isolation of Afro-Americans. It is both a medium-term substitution for, and a jump-start promotion of, the long-term solution of full ethnic integration. As integration is achieved, the need for affirmative action should be lessened. In this way, the program becomes self-canceling.

Two developments, however, hint at a possible subversion of this integrative process. One is the Afro-American identity movement, with its explicit rejection of integration and its celebration of ethnic separatism, as in the tendency of minority students to segregate themselves on the nation’s campuses and the increasing propensity for voluntarily segregated neighborhoods among the Afro-American middle class.

The other development is best exemplified by the Atlanta model of ethnic relations. This city, which prides itself on being “too busy to hate,” has fully embraced affirmative action, creating an environment with which the elites of both groups seem very comfortable. The only problem is that Atlanta remains extremely segregated. It seems as if a quid pro quo has emerged between the two dominant ethnic groups in which permanent affirmative action is accepted by the Euro-American elite as the price to be paid for the permanent segregation of the two groups—an adaptation of the old southern racist principle: separate, but now truly equal, at least among the elites. Were this indeed the case—and it is merely one interpretation of what is happening in Atlanta—it would be a disastrous contradiction not only of the ends of affirmative action but of its main justification, at least as I have argued it.

One way of preventing or aborting such an outcome is to place some time limit on affirmative action. The program has already achieved a great deal although Afro-Americans remain badly unconnected and in need of help in overcoming their isolation. I have proposed elsewhere that affirmative action be gradually phased out over 15 years, at which time it would be converted to a class-based program. During this period every effort should be made to break down all remaining barriers to integration, including Afro-American resistance to integrated neighborhoods, intermarriage, and trans-ethnic adoptions.

We could begin immediately to reduce the social cost of the program by removing all categories of disadvantaged persons except Afro-Americans, Puerto Ricans, second-generation Mexican Americans, Native Americans, and Euro-American women. In another five years or so we should remove all upper-middle-class persons, say those from families with incomes greater than $75,000. Ten years from now only working- and lower-class disadvantaged persons should be eligible, and Euro-American underprivileged persons could be phased in. In 15 years all ethnic criteria should be dropped; the resulting class-based program should last as long as poverty and underprivileged classes exist. As we ease out of the existing program and shift toward one based on socioeconomic disabilities, it becomes imperative that we reinforce and vigorously enforce laws against discrimination.

Placing a time limit on affirmative action would in all likelihood blunt the orchestrated politics of controversy that now bedevils it (see box below). And thinking about phasing it into a class-based entitlement program may at long last bring Americans around to a consideration of the growing inequality that threatens the harmony of our democracy far more than the alarmist cry of “racial division.”","March 1, 1998",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
6,The threat posed by deepfakes to marginalized communities,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-threat-posed-by-deepfakes-to-marginalized-communities/,Riana Pfefferkorn,"When we’re faced with a video recording of an event—such as an incident of police brutality—we can generally trust that the event happened as shown in the video. But that may soon change, thanks to the advent of so-called “deepfake” videos that use machine learning technology to show a real person saying and doing things they haven’t.

This technology poses a particular threat to marginalized communities. If deepfakes cause society to move away from the current “seeing is believing” paradigm for video footage, that shift may negatively impact individuals whose stories society is already less likely to believe. The proliferation of video recording technology has fueled a reckoning with police violence in the United States, recorded by bystanders and body-cameras. But in a world of pervasive, compelling deepfakes, the burden of proof to verify authenticity of videos may shift onto the videographer, a development that would further undermine attempts to seek justice for police violence. To counter deepfakes, high-tech tools meant to increase trust in videos are in development, but these technologies, though well-intentioned, could end up being used to discredit already marginalized voices.

Recent police killings of Black Americans caught on camera have inspired massive protests that have filled U.S. streets in the past year. Those protests endured for months in Minneapolis, where former police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted this week in the murder of George Floyd, a Black man. During Chauvin’s trial, another police officer killed Daunte Wright just outside Minneapolis, prompting additional protests as well as the officer’s resignation and arrest on second-degree manslaughter charges. She supposedly mistook her gun for her Taser—the same mistake alleged in the fatal shooting of Oscar Grant in 2009, by an officer whom a jury later found guilty of involuntary manslaughter (but not guilty of a more serious charge). All three of these tragic deaths—George Floyd, Daunte Wright, Oscar Grant—were documented in videos that were later used (or, in Wright’s case, seem likely to be used) as evidence at the trials of the police officers responsible. Both Floyd’s and Wright’s deaths were captured by the respective officers’ body-worn cameras, and multiple bystanders with cell phones recorded the Floyd and Grant incidents. Some commentators credit a 17-year-old Black girl’s video recording of Floyd’s death for making Chauvin’s trial happen at all.

The growth of the movement for Black lives in the years since Grant’s death in 2009 owes much to the rise in the availability, quality, and virality of bystander videos documenting police violence, but this video evidence hasn’t always been enough to secure convictions. From Rodney King’s assailants in 1992 to Philando Castile’s shooter 25 years later, juries have often declined to convict police officers even in cases where wanton police violence or killings are documented on video. Despite their growing prevalence, police bodycams have had mixed results in deterring excessive force or impelling accountability. That said, bodycam videos do sometimes make a difference, helping to convict officers in the killings of Jordan Edwards in Texas and Laquan McDonald in Chicago. Chauvin’s defense team pitted bodycam footage against the bystander videos employed by the prosecution, and lost.

What makes video so powerful? Why does it spur crowds to take to the streets and lawyers to showcase it in trials? It’s because seeing is believing. Shot at differing angles from officers’ point of view, bystander footage paints a fuller picture of what happened. Two people (on a jury, say, or watching a viral video online) might interpret a video two different ways. But they’ve generally been able to take for granted that the footage is a true, accurate record of something that really happened.

That might not be the case for much longer. It’s now possible to use artificial intelligence to generate highly realistic “deepfake” videos showing real people saying and doing things they never said or did, such as the recent viral TikTok videos depicting an ersatz Tom Cruise. You can also find realistic headshots of people who don’t exist at all on the creatively-named website thispersondoesnotexist.com. (There’s even a cat version.)

While using deepfake technology to invent cats or impersonate movie stars might be cute, the technology has more sinister uses as well. In March, the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a warning that malicious actors are “almost certain” to use “synthetic content” in disinformation campaigns against the American public and in criminal schemes to defraud U.S. businesses. The breakneck pace of deepfake technology’s development has prompted concerns that techniques for detecting such imagery will be unable to keep up. If so, the high-tech cat-and-mouse game between creators and debunkers might end in a stalemate at best.

If it becomes impossible to reliably prove that a fake video isn’t real, a more feasible alternative might be to focus instead on proving that a real video isn’t fake. So-called “verified at capture” or “controlled-capture” technologies attach additional metadata to imagery at the moment it’s taken, to verify when and where the footage was recorded and reveal any attempt to tamper with the data. The goal of these technologies, which are still in their infancy, is to ensure that an image’s integrity will stand up to scrutiny.

Photo and video verification technology holds promise for confirming what’s real in the age of “fake news.” But it’s also cause for concern. In a society where guilty verdicts for police officers remain elusive despite ample video evidence, is even more technology the answer? Or will it simply reinforce existing inequities?

The “ambitious goal” of adding verification technology to smartphone chipsets necessarily entails increasing the cost of production. Once such phones start to come onto the market, they will be more expensive than lower-end devices that lack this functionality. And not everyone will be able to afford them. Black Americans and poor Americans have lower rates of smartphone ownership than whites and high earners, and are more likely to own a “dumb” cell phone. (The same pattern holds true with regard to educational attainment and urban versus rural residence.) Unless and until verification technology is baked into even the most affordable phones, it risks replicating existing disparities in digital access.

That has implications for police accountability, and, by extension, for Black lives. Primed by societal concerns about deepfakes and “fake news,” juries may start expecting high-tech proof that a video is real. That might lead them to doubt the veracity of bystander videos of police brutality if they were captured on lower-end phones that lack verification technology. Extrapolating from current trends in phone ownership, such bystanders are more likely to be members of marginalized racial and socioeconomic groups. Those are the very people who, as witnesses in court, face an uphill battle in being afforded credibility by juries. That bias, which reared its ugly head again in the Chauvin trial, has long outlived the 19th-century rules that explicitly barred Black (and other non-white) people from testifying for or against white people on the grounds that their race rendered them inherently unreliable witnesses.

In short, skepticism of “unverified” phone videos may compound existing prejudices against the owners of those phones. That may matter less in situations where a diverse group of numerous eyewitnesses record a police brutality incident on a range of devices. But if there is only a single bystander witness to the scene, the kind of phone they own could prove significant.

The advent of mobile devices empowered Black Americans to force a national reckoning with police brutality. Ubiquitous, pocket-sized video recorders allow average bystanders to document the pandemic of police violence. And because seeing is believing, those videos make it harder for others to continue denying the problem exists. Even with the evidence thrust under their noses, juries keep acquitting police officers who kill Black people. Chauvin’s conviction this week represents an exception to recent history: Between 2005 and 2019, of the 104 law enforcement officers charged with murder or manslaughter in connection with a shooting while on duty, 35 were convicted.

The fight against fake videos will complicate the fight for Black lives. Unless it is equally available to everyone, video verification technology may not help the movement for police accountability, and could even set it back. Technological guarantees of videos’ trustworthiness will make little difference if they are accessible only to the privileged, whose stories society already tends to believe. We might be able to tech our way out of the deepfakes threat, but we can’t tech our way out of America’s systemic racism.","April 21, 2021",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
7,Is the Iranian-Saudi “cold war” heating up? How to reduce the temperature,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/is-the-iranian-saudi-cold-war-heating-up-how-to-reduce-the-temperature/,N/A,"Content from the Brookings Doha Center is now archived. In September 2021, after 14 years of impactful partnership, Brookings and the Brookings Doha Center announced that they were ending their affiliation. The Brookings Doha Center is now the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, a separate public policy institution based in Qatar.

While Saudi-Iranian tensions have been on the rise for years, Saudi Arabia’s execution of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr in January—met with angry reactions in Iran—heightened the stakes so dramatically that there is now serious potential for direct confrontation. Emotions are running high, and even an accidental spark could turn the cold war between the two regional powers hot. Their antagonism is a grave threat to the wider region, which isn’t exactly a bastion of stability these days—and it’s contrary to the long-term interests of Saudi Arabia and Iran.

Muhammad bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense, stressed in a January interview with The Economist that “a war between Saudi Arabia and Iran [would be] the beginning of a major catastrophe in the region,” adding: “For sure we will not allow any such thing.”

The prince is right—an outright Saudi-Iranian conflict would quickly spiral into a region-wide conflagration with gravely destabilizing effects on the Middle East and beyond. Yet the provocative rhetoric and actions of leaders on both sides continue to fan the flames.

Both sides must work to reduce the temperature and address the root causes of the tension. There are three main considerations that should inform the approach:

To head off outright confrontation, Saudi Arabia and Iran need to identify potential areas of shared interest. Both states’ economies are dependent on oil, and both are working to reduce that reliance. To some extent, each country’s economy depends on the other’s success. Both are targeted by the same terror groups, including al-Qaida and the Islamic State. And the countries face similar environmental threats, including oil spills, challenges related to accelerated industrialization, and water shortages. In all of these areas, Iran and Saudi Arabia can work together.

It won’t be easy, but there are helpful historical examples. Seventy years ago, no one could have imagined France, Germany, and Britain overcoming their regional rivalries to become close political and economic partners. And there are constructive roles for outside powers: Europe, for example, could facilitate more dialogue on religious tolerance in the Middle East, focusing on the 2004 Amman Message that all Muslims have common interests and can unite. Europe can also be more vigilant in ensuring that divisive sectarian clerics do not abuse their political asylum by using it as a platform to broadcast incendiary misinformation and propaganda that often crosses the line into hate speech. Meanwhile, multi-track diplomacy and various types of cultural, educational, and social exchanges between Saudis, Iranians, and others can help break down the barriers of misunderstanding and prejudice.

War between Iran and Saudi Arabia is not inevitable, but both sides must take steps now to turn down the heat. At the end of the day, it is in neither state’s interest to let their already poor relations spiral further downward.","June 22, 2016",Brookings Institution,race prejudice

9,Presumed Innocent? Representing Guantánamo Detainees,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/presumed-innocent-representing-guantanamo-detainees/,Benjamin Wittes,"The attacks on the Justice Department lawyers who had represented Guantanamo detainees angered me for several distinct reasons. They typified a growing culture of incivility in the politics of national security and law that I have always loathed and have spoken against repeatedly. They sought to delegitimize the legal defense of politically unpopular clients and to impose a kind of ideological litmus test on Justice Department service. They were also, at least in part, about friends and professional acquaintances. And they reminded me painfully of other friends during the Bush administration who had been similarly slimed and for whom the bar had failed to stand up.

The criticism had been simmering for some time in newspaper columns and editorials, but it exploded in the public arena with the now-infamous web ad by a group called Keep America Safe. The video, ostensibly about the Justice Department’s unwillingness to release the names of all of the lawyers who had worked on Gitmo, brands the unknown ones as the “Al Qaeda 7” and wonders “Why the secrecy” behind them? “Whose values do they share?” The two lawyers whose identities were already public—Principal Deputy Solicitor General Neal Katyal and an official in the department’s National Security Division named Jennifer Daskal—saw individual articles blasting them. Citing their service, The New York Post asked in a January editorial, “Whose side is the Justice Department on: America’s—or the terrorists’?” When the latest video appeared, I typed out a simple statement and began circulating it among colleagues for signatures.

I am a peculiar choice to organize what The New York Times later called “a Who’s Who of former Republican administration officials and conservative legal figures”—not being a former GOP official, a conservative, or even a lawyer. I occupy a strange place in the current debate over law and terror, sympathetic to important arguments made by both right and left. I have fiercely criticized both the Bush administration’s counterterrorism policies and the Obama administration’s—and fiercely defended both as well.

Yet as the attacks mounted, I wondered whether centrist and conservative lawyers, some of whom had suffered similar attacks themselves, would take a strong stand in defense of the Obama Justice Department lawyers. The answer, it turns out, was as encouraging as the attacks themselves were dispiriting. These lawyers responded with an outpouring of enthusiasm, resulting in a powerful rebuke to the political operatives who had launched the attacks.

Neal Katyal came under fire for having represented Salim Hamdan, Osama Bin Laden’s driver, in a challenge to the Bush administration’s original system of trying detainees in military commissions—a challenge that ultimately resulted in a landmark Supreme Court decision striking down the system in the absence of congressional authorization. “It’s just insane,” The New York Post huffed, “that a lawyer who defended Osama bin Laden‘s driver and bodyguard—and who sought constitutional rights for terrorists—could be one of the Obama administration’s top legal officials.”

Katyal, who is a good friend whom I first met back when he was still in law school, is a perfectly absurd target for conservative slings and arrows. Far from a conventional liberal, he has been one of the few truly distinctive voices in what has become a sterile and ideologically predictable debate over counterterrorism in the years since September 11. (Disclosure: Katyal also once collaborated with me on a project on the statutory law of counterterrorism jointly undertaken by the Georgetown University Law Center, where he then taught, the Brookings Institution, and the Hoover Institution.)

Katyal’s principal interest was not in defending Hamdan but in establishing the principle that the executive branch could not set up military commissions without going to Congress. In the course of the Hamdan case, however, he and his co-counsel had a duty to minimize their client’s role in Al Qaeda—though Katyal himself focused almost exclusively on the legal challenge, not on the factual defense. One might have wished on Katyal’s behalf that his client had been as pure as the driven snow—Hamdan was accused not merely of being a driver but of ferrying missiles as well—but angels don’t tend to end up in front of military commissions, and the test case for the system was destined to have some ugly facts that counsel would have to downplay or contest. To have done otherwise would have been unethical.

Unlike many people who got involved in detainee representations, Katyal never took the view that the Bush administration’s counterterrorism positions in general were lawless or inappropriate. He never challenged Hamdan’s detention, for example, only the system by which the Bush administration meant to try him for war crimes. In fact, he publicly resisted the early arguments that the courts should assume habeas jurisdiction over Guantanamo—arguing merely that they should preserve jurisdiction over challenges to the tribunals there. He later made common cause with scholars like Jack Goldsmith (and me) in arguing for a national security court to supervise detentions, and he vigorously defended the propriety of detaining enemy fighters outside of the criminal justice system—drawing the ire of many on the left in the process. Since going into government, to the surprise of nobody who knows him well, he has aggressively defended the current and former administrations’ resistance to the extension of habeas jurisdiction beyond Guantanamo to other military detentions overseas.

Ironically, given the suggestions that his current work may involve conflicts of interest, Katyal on arriving at the department voluntarily recused himself from all matters related to Guantanamo. The real problem, therefore, is not that he is pursuing any illicit agenda, but that his diverse and open mind is walled off from some of the harder problems the administration is confronting.

What’s more, whatever one thinks of the Supreme Court’s decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld—and I have my problems with it—it has clearly born salutary fruits, especially, ironically, for believers in military commissions. Before the Hamdan decision, the commissions existed by the authority of the president alone. Congress had no investment in them. Democrats had no investment either. The decision, however, forced the Bush administration to go to Congress and seek authorization for them, and this process of institutionalization has continued under the Obama administration and under a Democratic Congress—which refined the system in an admirably bipartisan process last year. While human rights groups and Europeans still complain about the commissions, the result has been a system that is viable now for administrations of both parties and which the Obama administration means to use in at least some cases. For anyone who believes in the institutionalization of robust counterterrorism authorities in statutory law, the quiet development of the military commission system over the past few years represents at least a tentative success story—and Katyal played a huge role in catalyzing that process.

Daskal presents a more complicated case. A former attorney for Human Rights Watch, she spent years as an advocate for an organization with positions no administration (of either party) would likely adopt. Daskal represented the positions of her group honorably and aggressively and thus has a long history of statements on detainee matters at which anyone who favors strong counterterrorism authorities might reasonably balk—against military commissions and against preventive detention without charge, for example. When she served in that role, she and I were often friendly sparring partners in public and private events, at which she would cast my views as threats to liberty and I would cast hers as maladaptive and fantastical dreaming. I’ll freely confess that when I first heard she was going to the department, I wondered about it.

Then I grew up. Even if Daskal believes every word she ever said as a Human Rights Watch lawyer, so what? The department’s National Security Division is no hotbed of human rights activism; it’s a place that takes national security extremely seriously. Having a diversity of voices in such a place is a healthy thing, not a problem.

More importantly, the relevant question is not what Daskal believes but whether she—or anyone else, for that matter—can put aside her own beliefs and represent the interests of her new client. Government lawyers, like private ones, face the problem routinely of aiding in the defense and development of positions in whose correctness they don’t believe. They have an obligation to put aside their own views and act in the interests of their clients in such situations, whether those situations involve the defense of campaign finance laws by Republican lawyers like former Solicitor General Ted Olson or the seeking of the death penalty by capital punishment opponents like Eric Holder. It is a simple matter of professionalism, and I have no reason to doubt that Daskal is a professional. Neither, other than rank prejudice, do the people who are attacking her.

The statement I tapped out made three basic points: that the attacks were unfair to the individuals in question; that the defense of detainees is an important function in any imaginable set of detention policies; and that the Justice Department benefits from a diversity of experience and philosophical points of view in any administration.

The overwhelming response from centrists and conservatives would have been more overwhelming still had the statement not leaked before I was ready to release it, thus forcing me to let it go early. Still, it included a large number of moderate, conservative, and very conservative luminaries of the bar who work in this area—many of them members of the prior administration, and all of them wanting to have the debate over law and terrorism on a civilized basis; that is, on the merits of difficult issues. In talking to people about the statement, however, I heard a recurring complaint from members of the prior administration, one that has in my opinion considerable merit: Our political and philosophical opponents never did this for us when the shoe was on the other foot, people said. Why did nobody stand up for the much-maligned lawyers of the Bush administration?

The attacks during the Bush administration were, of course, a somewhat different animal. They involved criticisms of people’s conduct—or in a few instances their imagined conduct—in office. They took place against the background of an administration whose lawyers had taken extraordinarily aggressive positions, sometimes so aggressive that subsequently other officials in the same administration would not stand behind the work product. To many Bush critics, such differences will seem decisive. The allegations during the last administration were about law-breaking, they will argue, not about the tarnishing of people based on honorable client representations. On the one side are a group of professionals who stood up for the law; on the other are people who undermined their profession by trying to help a client evade the law. End of story.

I beg to differ. The attacks then too were often exceedingly ugly and much less different than many people imagine. What links them is the unwillingness to defend the professionalism of people with whom one disagrees about the law—or with clients to whose policies or activities one objects. Vociferous criticism of some Bush-era Justice Department lawyers was altogether appropriate, but that criticism was often wildly over the top, deploying the language of war crimes and conspiracy to describe what was really just flawed, results-driven lawyering under circumstances of extraordinary pressure.

What’s more, even if one were to concede that some of the worst of the lawyering was criminal, the aura of villainy still swept well beyond those who had pushed the dramatic legal theories to people who were, like those now under attack, honorable professionals trying to give legal advice and represent government clients in good faith. It extended to career CIA lawyers whom field operatives were relying on to keep out of trouble. It extended to people who had worked hard within the administration to ameliorate policies that they then also had to defend in public.

And it extended to people like William J. Haynes II, the then-general counsel of the Pentagon, whose name is forever sullied in countless books, magazine articles, op-eds, and press releases for recommending the approval of coercive interrogation techniques at Guantanamo. Haynes, like Katyal, is a friend, someone about whom I do not pretend to be neutral. But it seems to me that his professionalism warranted a defense it never got. Haynes’s long tenure at the Defense Department was a complicated affair. He made mistakes, mistakes I probably would have made too had I been in his shoes. He also behaved very admirably at important junctures.

The memo for which he has been pilloried is also the reason that the military, unlike the CIA, never waterboarded anybody. Haynes recommended approval of certain modestly coercive techniques—the use of which later spun out of control—but he drew the line at several highly-coercive techniques, waterboarding included. Though they might be legal, he wrote, the military was trained in a tradition of restraint and shouldn’t use them. In other words, he behaved exactly the way the Left often criticizes the CIA for not behaving; even in a crisis setting, he refused to let the criminal law define military interrogation policy. Why is that fact not even part of the conversation about him?

Another example was Haynes’s reaction when then-OLC chief Jack Goldsmith later withdrew the key Justice Department legal opinion on which he had based some of his interrogation judgments. As Goldsmith later wrote, he knew the move would be “painful” for Haynes and he feared it would “weaken him within the department and harm his reputation.” Yet in Goldsmith’s account, Haynes responded altogether admirably. “The conversation lasted less than five minutes,” Goldsmith recalls in his book. “Haynes never pushed back, he and I never spoke at length about the issue again, and he never told me how he implemented the withdrawal within the Defense Department. I later learned, however, that he acted promptly on my request.”

Yet such facts are lost or distorted in much of the journalism and polemic that surrounds these issues. In Haynes’s case, as with some others, this is largely because he has not sought to distance himself from other officials who made different, more aggressive calls or to defend himself in the public arena by portraying himself as a moderating force against the monstrousness of others. In other cases, it’s because some facts were just too juicy to check, and if you say them three times they become true in any event.

Even people who spent their time in government actively seeking to ameliorate the excesses of Bush administration policy came under attack. Goldsmith himself left Justice after pulling the interrogation memos and precipitating a crisis in the administration over warrantless surveillance—only to find his appointment at the Harvard Law School opposed by some colleagues on the grounds that he was allegedly complicit in torture. They didn’t wait to know the facts.

Or take former Solicitor General Paul Clement. His office had frequently pushed the executive branch towards greater moderation in counterterrorism policies, using the threat of Supreme Court setbacks to make policymakers think about detainee access to counsel, for example, and the end-game for long-term military detentions of citizens. None of that prevented people from falsely suggesting that he lied to the Supreme Court about torture.

Similarly, State Department lawyers and policy makers who fought to make U.S. detention policy more defensible in America’s international relations emerged from government to find themselves accused of war crimes.

Even career officials were not immune. A long-serving CIA lawyer friend of mine found himself blasted by a congressional committee and in the blogosphere for a comment he informed the committee he never made. Very few people cared that the comment was an apparent fiction.

And therein lies the conservative anger: The people who made often reckless allegations about Bush administration officials—Harper’s writer Scott Horton, for example, has called Haynes a “Torture Lawyer”; The New York Times all but called for his indictment—have never been forced to wrestle with their smears. Very few people ever stood up publicly for the professionalism—even in disagreement and criticism—of members of the last administration who were trying with varying degrees of success to get the right answers to questions that were no easier then than they are now. That fact is worth a moment’s pause.

Ironically, one of those who did stand up was Katyal himself, who penned a piece in 2007 with Ted Olson decrying both attacks on the patriotism of defense counsel and “the vilification of government lawyers involved in the war on terror.”

I yield to nobody in defense of Katyal, Daskal, and however many other lawyers there may be at Justice who engaged in honorable advocacy on behalf of a group of people I believe the government should have robust authorities against. But perhaps now that the dust has settled on the Bush administration, we might ask ourselves a question that warranted consideration long ago: Why didn’t the bar stand up and defend professionals on the other side as well when those people were under assault?","March 24, 2010",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
10,Affirmative Action as an International Human Rights Dialogue: Considered Opinion,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/affirmative-action-as-an-international-human-rights-dialogue-considered-opinion/,Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"A 1995 United Nations report estimated that white Americans, if ranked as a separate nation, would lead the world in well-being, a measure that combines life expectancy, educational achievement, and income. African Americans, in contrast, would rank a depressing twenty-seventh, while Hispanic Americans would rank even lower at thirty-second. The authors of the UN report observed: “full equality still is a distant prospect in the United States, despite affirmative action policies and market opportunities.”

The words affirmative action do not appear in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the foundation document for contemporary human rights discourse. The declaration does, however, contain two intellectual anchors for affirmative action. First, the declaration repeatedly endorses the principle of human equality. Second, it declares that everyone has the right to work, to an adequate standard of living, and to education. The declaration does not command that all will share equally, but it does suggest strongly that there are minimum levels of employment, education, and subsistence that all should share. If a nation finds that citizens of one race?or sex or religion?endure a markedly inadequate standard of living, then, the declaration suggests, it has an obligation to uncover the cause of, and respond to, that endurance.

If we take seriously the promises of employment, education, and sustenance made in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the discrepancies in racial well-being in the United States noted by the United Nations report demand affirmative government attention. It seems implausible that such marked differences would occur with no discrimination lurking in the background.

Affirmative action entered the U.S. legal lexicon in its contemporary connotation in 1961, although it did not shift into high gear until 1969, when President Richard Nixon?s Labor Department issued its Revised Philadelphia Plan, requiring government contractors in that city to set goals and timetables for hiring minority workers in six construction trades. Contractors who failed to comply risked loss of their valuable contracts. The Nixon administration?s plan to break away from historic practices, including trade union nepotism, generated controversy. But it survived both public criticism and legal challenges for, I believe, two reasons. First, it did not impose rigid quotas on government contractors, instead requiring contractors to set their own goals by examining the availability of minority workers in the local workforce. Second, although the Philadelphia Plan cited no international covenants, it rested on the twin supports of remedial justice and economic equity. It responded both to overt and subtle forms of racial bias and to a crisis in the economic well-being of minority Americans.

The U.S. Supreme Court first ruled on the constitutionality of a race-based affirmative action plan in 1978, in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke. The case produced six opinions from nine Justices, with the views of a single Justice, Lewis E. Powell, Jr., controlling the outcome. Justice Powell disapproved a state-run medical school?s affirmative action program, which set aside about one-sixth of the school?s seats for minority students, but he wrote that public universities could consider race as one factor, among several, when admitting students.

Like the designers of the Philadelphia Plan, Justice Powell resisted fixed quotas. Schools could consider minority race as a factor favoring admission, but could not designate a set number of seats for minority students. Although Justice Powell?s Bakke opinion rejected most of the justifications urged by the government in support of affirmative action, he did accept one?that a racially diverse student body would enrich the educational experience for all students. That reasoning is in line with article 26 of the Universal Declaration, which states that public education “shall be directed” to “promoting understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups.”

During the past two decades the Court has become increasingly skeptical of race-based affirmative action practiced or ordered by government actors. State and local attempts to remedy “societal discrimination” have not survived Court scrutiny, despite empirical evidence documenting persistent racial discrimination in education, employment, housing, and consumer transactions. The narrowing of the channel of constitutionally permissible race-based affirmative action has prompted empirical studies reporting the effects of affirmative action in both classrooms and workplaces and has caused even some long-time opponents of affirmative action to reconsider their opposition. What we are witnessing now may show the sagacity of the comment that the true symbol of the United States is not the bald eagle but the pendulum.

The United States, although a way paver, is hardly alone in endeavoring to redress historical and lingering deprivations of the basic civil right to equality and to advance the well-being of minorities that disproportionately experience poverty, unemployment, and ill health. India, for example, has undertaken affirmative action initiatives in regard to disfavored castes that are both older and more extensive than any program ventured in the United States. India?s 1950 Constitution boldly announced a commitment to affirmative action, reserving seats for members of India?s lowest social castes in both the House of the People and the state legislative assemblies. And in 1951, in response to a court ruling striking down a quota for students from disadvantaged classes at a state-run medical school, India amended its constitution expressly to permit affirmative action in education and other contexts. Article 15(4) now provides that “[n]othing in [the constitution?s anti-discrimination articles] shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens.” India?s Supreme Court did impose, in 1963, a 50 percent ceiling on the number of positions that can be reserved for disadvantaged citizens?a limit that may appear startling to observers from legal systems more skeptical of affirmative action.

In the area of human rights, experience in one nation or region may inspire or inform other nations or regions. When India?s Supreme Court has judged the constitutionality of affirmative action measures, for example, it has considered U.S. precedents. The same readiness to look beyond one?s own shores has not marked the decisions of the court on which I serve. The U.S. Supreme Court has mentioned the Universal Declaration of Human Rights a spare five times and only twice in a majority decision. The most recent citation appeared 29 years ago, in a dissenting opinion by Justice Marshall. Nor does the U.S. Supreme Court note the laws or decisions of other nations with any frequency. When Justice Breyer referred in 1997 to federal systems in Europe, dissenting from a decision in which I also dissented, the majority responded: “We think such comparative analysis inappropriate to the task of interpreting a constitution.”

In my view, comparative analysis emphatically is relevant to the task of interpreting constitutions and enforcing human rights. We are the losers if we neglect what others can tell us about endeavors to eradicate bias against women, minorities, and other disadvantaged groups. For irrational prejudice and rank discrimination are infectious in our world. In this reality, as well as the determination to counter it, we all share.","December 1, 2000",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
11,How India reformed its petroleum sector,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-india-reformed-its-petroleum-sector/,Vikram Singh Mehta,"Content from the Brookings Institution India Center is now archived. After seven years of an impactful partnership, as of September 11, 2020, Brookings India is now the Centre for Social and Economic Progress, an independent public policy institution based in India.

Indian newspapers have carried a series of interesting recollections by bureaucrats and technocrats of their involvement in the economic reform programme of 1991. None talked about the energy sector and, in particular, petroleum. This was understandable as their focus was on the macroeconomy. Sectoral changes were, however, under consideration and within the interstices of officialdom, there was growing recognition of the inefficiencies of a state- controlled, public sector dominated energy sector. The bureaucrats’ dilemma was how to resolve the seemingly conflictual dynamics of the market and competitive forces on the one hand and political concerns on the other. A review of their efforts to manage this dilemma over the next 25 years provides an insight into the influence of interest groups in determining the pace and direction of policy change and, more generally, the challenge of balancing good economics with prudent politics.

The Berlin Wall collapsed in 1989 and that weakened somewhat the ideological prejudice towards the market and the private sector. Up to this event, most politicians and bureaucrats had espoused the Nehruvian view, at least in public, that energy was part of the commanding heights of the economy and that its custodianship should be entrusted only to the 100 per cent state-owned enterprises — ONGC/OIL (exploration and production of oil/gas), IOC, BPCL and HPCL (refining and marketing of petroleum products) and Coal India (extraction of coal). They had been supportive of the nationalisation of the private companies and were votaries of the administered cost plus pricing system that assured these public sector companies a fixed 12-15 per cent post-tax return on capital employed and protection from market pressures and competition. They had a vested interest in the status quo.

Post 1989, and following the then Finance Minister Manmohan Singh’s invocation of Victor Hugo on July 24, 1991 “no power on earth can hold back an idea whose time has come” to herald the dismantlement of the licence raj and state dirigisme, the petroleum ministry mandarins acknowledged that the time had come to reorder the petroleum sector. The inefficiencies of the existing system had by then become evident. Production (ex Mumbai High) of oil/gas and coal was on a downward trend; the public distribution system for subsidised kerosene and LPG had become a sieve for black marketing and the administered price differential between naphtha, petrol, diesel and kerosene had created incentives for distributors and dealers to adulterate transportation fuels.

The government set up the “R” (reforms) group in 1995 under the chairmanship of the then petroleum secretary Vijay Kelkar to recommend measures for creating a world-class petroleum industry. The hidden text in their terms of reference was to offer a way ahead that did not upset the political applecart. The committee proposed a phased “soft landing”. In the first phase they recommended the liberalisation of those segments of the petroleum value chain that did not interface with the public. Thus, they suggested that refining be opened up to private investment and that the price of intermediate products like naphtha, aviation fuel and bitumen be determined by the market. On the other hand, they suggested that the politically sensitive segments like the marketing of petrol and diesel and the pricing of kerosene and LPG be deregulated in incremental steps over four years. Their generic recommendation was that the petroleum sector should be fully unshackled from administrative oversight over this period. The cabinet approved these proposals in 1998 and a gazette notification pronounced that the sector would be deemed fully deregulated on April 1, 2002. Furthermore, they placed HPCL and IBP on the list for disinvestment.

The government knew that the current system and structure was generating huge avoidable costs. But they could not convert their intent into action. The blocker was the combined clout of vested interests and lack of political will. The first casualty was disinvestment. The labour unions were opposed to this idea and they successfully lobbied to stall the sale of IBP and HPCL. As the IBP bid process had already formally commenced, the government twisted IOC’s corporate arm to “bid” an irrationally high price that was almost twice that of the next highest contender. In consequence, IBP (a 100 per cent government company) came to be folded into IOC (another 100 per cent government company). The HPCL case was not quite so blatant. Its legality was challenged and the process was stayed. The next casualty was free market pricing. Politicians, nervous about asking the consumer to bear the burden of rising international oil prices, persuaded the government to reimpose administrative pricing and the companies to bear the consequential subsidy burden. All petroleum companies had, by then, got listed on the stock exchange. (Surprisingly, no one challenged the management to explain the lackadaisical performance of the share price of these companies in a bull market.) Interestingly, the government did not revoke the gazette notification. And so from April 1, 2002 to recently, the industry operated in the netherworld of de jure free market but de facto administrative control.

Petroleum sector reform offers an insight into the compromises and unpredictabilities of managing economic change in a democratic polity. Looking ahead, the government should reflect on the questions. What will it do if the price of oil moves beyond its comfort zone? Will it revert to the status quo ante of administrative pricing? And if they do stay the course of deregulation, how will the government manage its political concerns?

12,The US military’s integration of transgender troops: Another milestone in social change,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-us-militarys-integration-of-transgender-troops-another-milestone-in-social-change/,Elaine Kamarck,"This week’s decision to allow transgender individuals to serve in the military is yet one more reminder of how quickly social change happens in the 21st century. Defense Secretary Ash Carter’s announcement comes two years after the announcement that the military was lifting the ban on women in combat and four years since the announcement that it was lifting the ban on openly gay troops.

In contrast, the move to end desegregation in the military began with the formation of the Gillem Commission (named after Army Lt. General Alvan C. Gillem Jr.) which was appointed to study the Army’s race policies in 1945. In 1948 President Truman issued an executive order desegregating the military, and then, very slowly, change happened—with violence and setbacks along the way—until in 1954 the Army deactivated the 94th Engineer Battalion, the last all black unit in the armed forces.

In contrast, in a mere four years the military has overturned nearly every sexual prejudice—which is not to say that the implementation will be smooth. As was the case with black people in the military there will certainly be episodes ranging from subtle discrimination to outright violence as people get used to the change. But the warp speed with which some pretty deep seeded sexual discriminations have been addressed makes one wonder if there isn’t something about this new century that makes for more rapid social change.

One possibility is that the ubiquity of social media allows for better and faster story telling of the kind that breaks down even the most stubborn biases. Take, for example, the Huffington Post human interest story about Sargent Shane Ortega, a 28-year-old helicopter crew chief serving in Hawaii. He’s about as decent and upstanding soldier as you can find and to look at his bulging muscles, thick neck, and copious tattoos you’d never guess that he used to be a she. He gets to tell his story, and between the Huffington Post, the Washington Post, and ABC News millions know who he is.

Or take the example of the book Ashley’s War: The Untold Story of a Team of Women Soldiers on the Special Ops Battlefied. Named for Lt. Ashley White Stumpf, the first member of the newly created Cultural Support Teams to be killed in action, the book recounts the experiences of a group of women assigned to accompany Special Forces in Afghanistan. They served prior to the lifting of the ban on women in combat in villages to interrogate women and children in the highly sexually segregated Muslim world of rural Afghanistan. Ashley’s War made the best seller lists and is being turned into a movie.

There is nothing that breaks down prejudices faster than feeling you know someone—a gay soldier, a female soldier or a transgender soldier—who you can admire. The kind of numbers these stories are getting dwarf newspaper and newsreel circulation from the twentieth century and they help take us as a society from abstract prejudice to concrete admiration.","July 16, 2015",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
13,Bowling with Trump,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/bowling-with-trump/,"Mark Fabian, Robert Breunig","Why did Donald Trump win the 2016 Presidential Election? Numerous reasons were canvassed in the aftermath of the result. Among them were the emergent power of social media and fake news (Allcott and Gentzkow 2017), Russian interference (Hall Jamieson 2018), the gap between low and high educated whites (Schaffner et al. 2017), lavish media attention on Trump (Sides et al. 2018), anti-incumbency (ibid.), economic anxiety (Autor et al. 2016), sexism (Valentino et al. 2019), and racism (Hooghe and Dassonneville 2018). In a prominent recent review of the literature and the evidence, Sides et al. (ibid.) acknowledge some role for all these factors but argue that the key force behind Trump’s victory was “racialized economics” and Trump’s willingness and ability to leverage it. Racialized economics is the tendency among some voters to consider economic issues not through an individual lens but through a racial one instead. As Sides et al. (2018, p. 8) explain:

The important sentiment underlying Trump’s support was not “I might lose my job” but, in essence, “people in my group are losing jobs to that other group”. Instead of pure economic anxiety, what mattered was racialized economics.

We quantitatively analyze this hypothesis using a very large dataset—the Gallup Daily Poll—and explicate the psychological roots of racialized economics. We argue that there is a channel from economic shocks to nativist voting via psychological wellbeing. Self-determination theory (SDT, Ryan and Deci 2017), a school of clinical psychology, argues that psychological well-being is a function of three basic psychological needs: for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. When these are thwarted, people will try to compensate. As economic decline in America is substantially a function of exogenous forces of globalization and technological change, there is little individuals can do to bolster their feelings of autonomy and competence. They may therefore focus on relatedness. One way to bolster their feelings of relatedness is by affiliating with salient identity groups such as race and nation. Similarly, theories of so-called “worldview defense” (WDT) argue that when people feel worried they will double-down on their in-group affiliations (Holbrook et al. 2011). In laboratory studies these typically overlap with broad identity markers like race and nation. Both literatures imply that economic decline, through its pernicious effect on psychological wellbeing, could encourage in-group bias. We argue that Trump, with his “America First” and “Build a Wall” policies and his nativist rhetoric, fueled and harnessed these sentiments to secure the Presidency.

Honing our hypothesis, a key inference of SDT and WDT is that in-group bias is more likely to manifest as identification with a broad group like race or nation when more intimate sources of group identification, like a church group or sports club, are unavailable. Sociologists have long noted that small, local sources of in-group identity, like bowling leagues and trade unions, have declined precipitously across America in recent decades (Putnam 2000, 2015). Religious affiliation and church attendance are similarly in free-fall (Pew Research Centre 2019). In line with the inferences of SDT and WDT, qualitative studies of Trump voters have tied this cultural decay to his success (Cramer 2016). A central thesis of Carney’s (2019) Alienated America is that Trump had greater cut through in areas with low levels of social capital and weak social institutions. Similarly, in her study of Tea Party supporters in Louisiana, Hochschild (2016, p. 225) writes that Trump’s “supporters have been in mourning for a lost way of life”.

The difference between these two labels may seem a matter of semantics, but making the transition from the first to the second represents a profound, if somewhat silent, revolution that many of us in the Muslim community have been undergoing in the two years since Sept. 11.

On its face, this shift would seem to threaten the very core of Muslim identity and empowerment. After all, in the decade before the events of Sept. 11, Islam was one of the fastest-growing religions in North America. Mosques and Islamic schools were going up in every major city. Groups like the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the American Muslim Alliance established chapters in nearly every area with a Muslim population.

Muslim leaders, once a frustrated and marginal group, found themselves being courted by politicians, the news media and foreign governments seeking their support and influence. Indeed, many Muslims believe it was their votes that made the difference in Florida, making them primarily responsible for placing President Bush in the White House.

At the time, the word that best summed up the Muslim sense of self was “fateh”—a conqueror. Many religious and community leaders were convinced that Islam would not only manifest itself in its truest form in this country, but would also make America—already a great power—into a great society. Some even proclaimed that one day America would be an Islamic state.

On Sept. 11, of course, that dream evaporated. Today, the civil rights environment has declined drastically with the passage of the USA Patriot Act and other antiterrorism measures. Both sources of Islam’s growth—immigration and conversion—are now in jeopardy, and we continue to face hostility and prejudice in many corners of society. There is no more talk of making America an Islamic state. Any reminder of this pre-9/11 vision generates sheepish giggles and snorts from Muslim audiences.

Yet adjusting to the new political and social realities of life in the United States these past two years has also had unexpected and positive effects for many Muslims. We have been compelled to transform ourselves to connect more intimately with American mainstream society.

Today, many Muslims realize that it is not their Islamic identity but their American citizenship that is fragile. Before Sept. 11, Muslims in America focused primarily on changing United States policy toward Palestine, Kashmir and Iraq. Since Sept. 11, the attempt to reconstitute our identity as American Muslims is making domestic relations—and civil rights and interfaith relations—more important.

Much of this is playing out at the local level. In Miami, for example, efforts are underway by a group of progressive Muslims to endow chairs in Islamic studies at American universities. In the Muslim community in Duluth, Minn., fund-raising has begun to support social services, including housing and health care initiatives for the poor. In Indianapolis, Muslim residents are opening soup kitchens. And think of the familiar advertising campaign by the Council on American-Islamic Relations in which Muslims announce, “We are American and we are Muslims.” It is not without design that “American” is stated first.

Even more vital, many Muslims in this country have come to acutely understand the vulnerabilities of minorities and the importance of democracy and civil rights. Because we took our American citizenship for granted, we did not acknowledge its value and virtues. But now that it is imperiled, the overwhelming desire of many Muslims is that America remain true to its democratic and secular values.

This summer I addressed the National Imams’ Conference in Washington and spent a week in the Sierras with 400 American Muslims. I had extended conversations with participants. Both leaders and ordinary Muslims seem to be possessed with a strong desire for change and self-transformation. These were some of the frequent sentiments that I heard:

“America is our home, we will not become foreigners in our own homeland.” “Islam is about invitation and peace, not conflict.” “We have to take back Islam and also win back the hearts and minds of Americans.”

It is unfortunate that American Muslim identity is being reconstructed under duress. But it can still be a meaningful and transcendent experience. The aftermath of Sept. 11 may have shattered some dreams, but it has also forced us to reconnect with reality and empower ourselves.

There is still much progress to be made. We need to continue to demonstrate that Muslims in this country constitute an ethical and philanthropic community that cares about humanitarian causes, about America and Americans and stands for justice and rights as embodied in the Constitution. Just like other ethnic groups before us, we have to pay our dues to this nation before we demand that they change themselves and the world for us.

But Americans, too, must play a role. They cannot allow events overseas to foster anti-Muslim sentiments and Islamophobia at home. They must recognize the insecurities and fears of their Muslim neighbors and extend a hand of friendship and support. The choices we face are tough, but Muslims must realize that the interests of our sons and daughters, who are American, must come before the interests of our brothers and sisters, whether they are Palestinian, Kashmiri or Iraqi. Only then will Muslims in America become American Muslims.","September 7, 2003",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
15,Why we need to recommit to gender equality,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-we-need-to-recommit-to-gender-equality/,"Armene Modi, Bhawana Shrestha","This year, as the world celebrates International Women’s Day on March 8 under the theme “For ALL Women and Girls: Rights. Equality. Empowerment,” we also mark the 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action—a landmark global commitment to gender equality. This milestone offers an invitation to reflect on progress over the past three decades and also reinforces the urgency of advancing women’s and girls’ rights, challenging systemic inequalities, and reshaping power structures to ensure a more just and equitable world. Thirty years on from Beijing, we are witnessing a growing anti-gender agenda and an alarming backlash against girls’ and women’s rights, what CNN described as a “connected, well-funded and spreading” movement, both in the U.S. and globally.

This commentary shares insights from members of the Echidna Global Scholars Alumni Network working in India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Kenya. Long-standing champions of gender equality in and through education, they leverage research grounded in their deep practical experience to inform action from the grassroots to the policy level. The Echidna Scholars highlight progress made, persistent challenges, and the critical actions needed to not only drive meaningful change for girls and women, but to promote more gender equal societies that bring economic, health and social benefits to us all. To ensure all women and girls have equal access to their rights, both in and through education, it is critical to reaffirm a commitment to gender justice and to push back against regressive forces that seek to undermine hard-won gains.

While India has made considerable progress in girls’ education over the past 30 years, gender equality in India is inseparable from caste, class, religion, geographic location, language, and skin color. At the lowest rung of the caste system, girls and young women in Dalit communities face overlapping challenges in exercising their right to quality education. Even when they access schooling, they experience prejudice, stigmatization, hostility, and humiliation from teachers and peers, harming their self-image. They also face corporal punishment, segregation in classroom seating and midday meals, restricted access to drinking water, and are sometimes forced to clean toilets, and sweep classrooms and school grounds–forms of discrimination that other girls and male students do not experience.

These challenges lead to high dropout rates. While Dalit girls’ elementary school enrollment is 99%, nearly two-thirds do not finish. Enrollment in higher education is less than half that of upper-caste women, and Dalit women who have gained access to higher levels of education report discriminatory practices such as segregation of hostels, denial of access to library facilities, and humiliating jokes like “Quote se aye ho ya kothe se” (Have you come via the quota system or a brothel?).

India’s 2011 census reported that Dalit women’s literacy rate, at 56.5%, lagged nearly 10 percentage points behind the national average for women. Until all girls, regardless of their caste, are able to exercise their education rights, their life prospects will continue to be significantly limited.

Similarly, although there have been significant improvements in girls’ education in Nepal over the past decades, challenges persist related to unique social and cultural norms based on geographical and cultural differences. At just 57%, the national literacy rate for women is nearly twenty percentage points behind that of men (75%). However, when we dig deeper, we see that the rate among girls in marginalized communities remains significantly lower, ranging from 14% to 28% in Dom, Mushar, Netuwa, and Champs-Harijan communities. These communities have historically faced caste-based discrimination and socioeconomic exclusion, including the practice of “untouchability,” influenced by the four fold Varna system of Hinduism.

Although the Government of Nepal legally abolished and criminalized any caste-based discrimination in 1968, these communities continue to face challenges in accessing their right to education. By centering the lived experiences of girls within their social and cultural contexts, it becomes evident that they might be excluded from progressive educational reforms. The National Review Report (2001-2015) by the Ministry of Education acknowledges the significant education gaps among different castes and ethnic groups in Nepal, indicating the need for targeted interventions that address unique barriers related to factors such as class, caste, and cultural, as well as economic context.

Pakistan is one of the few countries where gender parity is not improving, and it ranks near the bottom of the gender parity index. In research we are conducting as part of the Learning and Action Alliance for Girls’ Agency (LAAGA), we’ve found that most girls are not allowed to make decisions about their lives, unlike their brothers or other boys of their age. Even when they aspire to improve their lives, they often lack the agency to do so. Many girls feel unprepared to make decisions or set goals for themselves, believing that they lack the necessary skills, confidence, and exposure to help them understand social issues. Typically the final decisionmakers, fathers, are key to girls’ agency. Although mothers may also influence their daughter’s decisions, girls who report being able to exercise agency often relate this to having support from their fathers.

When it comes to decisions girls can make, traveling and having a public life are among those most often restricted. Parents’ reluctance to allow these decisions typically stems from safety concerns, particularly due to the behavior of men and boys. Girls believe that if men and boys behave more responsibly and respectfully, neither they nor their parents would fear their participation in public life. This highlights how the role of male family members and men in society significantly affect the lives—and rights—of girls and young women in Pakistan. It also underscores how strongly girls’ agency is tied to the behavior of men and boys. Addressing social norms is essential to expanding girls’ autonomy and opportunities and advancing gender equality.

Throughout history, women and girls have borne the brunt of climate catastrophes, disasters, educational challenges, and economic hardships. Women worldwide play a crucial role in rebuilding communities and enhancing resilience, yet their contributions often go unrecognized. Rural women in Bangladesh have transformed the garment industry and economy, where they make up nearly two-thirds of the 4.5 million workers, yet they face barriers to advancement. In Afghanistan, women-led grassroots organizations continue to address vital needs in education, agriculture and enterprise despite significant challenges. In Vietnam, women participate almost equally in agriculture but face barriers to training and resources, limiting their impact. Globally, Indigenous and Afro-descendant women are essential in environmental conservation, yet they often lack legal recognition and funding.

Research also shows that higher female representation in government leads to more inclusive climate policies, though women are frequently excluded from decisionmaking in natural resource management and climate finance. From Leymah Gbowee’s peace movement in Liberia to grassroots resilience efforts in Bosnia, Türkiye, Syria, and Armenia, women have shaped lasting solutions. The UNDP stresses that gender-inclusive leadership results in better social and economic recovery. Studies show that peace agreements involving women are 35% more likely to last at least 15 years.

As we celebrate International Women’s Day 2025 under the theme “For ALL women and girls: Rights. Equality. Empowerment,” let us renew our commitment to accelerate action, ensuring that every woman and girl is empowered, recognized, and provided the equal opportunities they deserve to lead and transform the world.

International Women’s Day holds profound significance as a global recognition of women’s achievements and struggles. Though long strides have been made in achieving gender equality, increasing girls enrollment at all levels of school inclusion, and inclusion in paid work and political spaces, there is a much longer road to travel. Our daughters and sisters are still vulnerable─still unsafe, unfree, and, in many cases, unwanted. The ongoing regression in women’s rights in various parts of the world, particularly in countries like the U.S. and Afghanistan, raises pressing concerns about the global commitment to gender equality.

In Afghanistan, the systematic erosion of women’s human right to education, to voluntarily engage in paid work outside the home, to free mobility under Taliban rule has reached alarming levels. While the world is 25 years into the 21st century, the Taliban continues to brazenly violate women’s most fundamental human rights to education, freedom of expression, and free mobility, with great impunity. The lack of global mobilization is deeply troubling, and the silence and inaction of global gender equality actors raises serious questions about commitments to gender equality.

Similarly, the situation in the U.S., a country that claims to be one of the strongest democracies in the world and a leader in human rights, presents another cause for concern.  The Supreme Court has taken away women’s rights to their own bodies, including their reproductive rights, by overturning Roe vs Wade. The Taliban does not pretend to be a democracy, but the US proudly claims to be one. How can they ignore the rights of one half of their population?

On this International Women’s Day, there must be a renewed commitment to standing in solidarity with women worldwide–whether they are fighting authoritarian oppression in Afghanistan or against regressive legal decisions in the United States. The struggle for gender equality is far from over, and this day should remind us that action is required.

Adolescent girls hold the key to prosperity for the African continent. With over 150 million adolescent girls calling Africa home, the potential for transformative change is immense. Africa currently stands at a crossroads, with its future prosperity hinged on the policy and investment decisions it makes today. The challenges adolescent girls face persist; over half of African adolescent girls aged 15-19 are out of school, married, or have children, compared to just 17 percent of boys in the same age range, highlighting the urgent need for action (CGD, 2024).

How can African countries overcome these challenges to ensure adolescent girls participate in school, learn, and achieve their potential, ultimately building human capital to become empowered and thrive?

To succeed, adolescent girls must obtain the skills and resources that will support them to exercise their agency, strengthen their autonomy and promote their prosperity in adulthood. Research in Kenya and Uganda as part of LAAGA (2023/2024) research series, have shown that adolescent girls need safety in and out of school, sanitary pads and necessary clothing, and financial support to cover school fees so they can remain in school and not be left behind in education. Importantly, they need their voices to be listened to and taken into consideration for decision making. Extensive research and consultations with adolescent girls, as well as with policy makers and practitioners, could address evidence and data gaps in programming and policy for adolescent girls’ empowerment through education. Girls look to their support systems—teachers, parents, government and community leaders, educators, and policymakers—to ensure they are not left behind. Let’s listen to them and bring them into the center of our actions and advocacy.

Pakistan’s social environment is marked by inequality, marginalization, and vulnerabilities affecting the majority of its population. With a Gender Parity Index ranking of 135 out of 166 countries, barriers to gender equality are systemic and embedded within interwoven economic, political, and social structures. Women and girls who experience multiple forms of marginalization often belong to lower income households.

Social challenges for adolescent girls and young women include stereotypical and gendered roles and power dynamics within homes and communities, pressure for early marriage, restrictions on mobility, and both real and perceived protection concerns. These challenges are deeply rooted in societal norms and limit opportunities for financially gainful activities for women, creating a cyclical phenomenon that exacerbates their financial woes and social burdens.

Recent conversations with adolescent girls and young women associated with the Aappa Aziz Trust in an urban slum area of Multan, South Punjab, Pakistan as part of LAAGA, confirmed the burden of societal gender norms that restrict the pursuit of their personal goals and aspirations. As explained by these girls, close knit social relations, such as neighbors and close relatives, raise objections to their mobility, influencing parental decisions. Another factor limiting their freedom is street harassment by young boys and men, which leads families to become overly protective. Additionally, financial hardship restricts their ability to pursue further education, develop skills, or start a business. To create opportunities for girls and young women to thrive and achieve their life goals and aspirations, it is imperative to ease restrictive social norms, put an end to gender-based violence in the form of street harassment by men and boys, and provide financial support for them.","March 7, 2025",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
16,Why are states banning critical race theory?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-are-states-banning-critical-race-theory/,"Rashawn Ray, Alexandra Gibbons","Fox News has mentioned “critical race theory” 1,300 times in less than four months. Why? Because critical race theory (CRT) has become a new bogeyman for people unwilling to acknowledge our country’s racist history and how it impacts the present.

To understand why CRT has become such a flash point in the culture, it is important to understand what it is and what it is not. Opponents fear that CRT admonishes all white people for being oppressors while classifying all Black people as hopelessly oppressed victims. These fears have spurred school boards and state legislatures from Tennessee to Idaho to ban teachings about racism in classrooms. However, there is a fundamental problem: these narratives about CRT are gross exaggerations of the theoretical framework. The broad brush that is being applied to CRT is puzzling to academics, including some of the scholars who coined and advanced the framework.

CRT does not attribute racism to white people as individuals or even to entire groups of people. Simply put, critical race theory states that U.S. social institutions (e.g., the criminal justice system, education system, labor market, housing market, and healthcare system) are laced with racism embedded in laws, regulations, rules, and procedures that lead to differential outcomes by race. Sociologists and other scholars have long noted that racism can exist without racists. However, many Americans are not able to separate their individual identity as an American from the social institutions that govern us—these people perceive themselves as the system. Consequently, they interpret calling social institutions racist as calling them racist personally. It speaks to how normative racial ideology is to American identity that some people just cannot separate the two. There are also people who may recognize America’s racist past but have bought into the false narrative that the U.S. is now an equitable democracy. They are simply unwilling to remove the blind spot obscuring the fact that America is still not great for everyone.

Scholars and activists who discuss CRT are not arguing that white people living now are to blame for what people did in the past. They are saying that white people living now have a moral responsibility to do something about how racism still impacts all of our lives today. Policies attempting to suffocate this much-needed national conversation are an obstacle to the pursuit of an equitable democracy. Supporters of CRT bans often quote Martin Luther King Jr’s proclamation that individuals should be viewed by the content of their character instead of the color of their skin, ignoring the context of the quote and the true meaning behind it.

To better understand how widespread these efforts are to ban critical race theory from U.S. classrooms, we did an assessment of anti-CRT state legislation. Here’s what we found:

The approach of some Republican-led state legislatures is a method for continuing to roll back racial progress regarding everything from voting rights to police reform. This is a horrible idea and does an injustice to our kids. Laws forbidding any teacher or lesson from mentioning race/racism, and even gender/sexism, would put a chilling effect on what educators are willing to discuss in the classroom and provide cover for those who are not comfortable hearing or telling the truth about the history and state of race relations in the United States. Ironically, “making laws outlawing critical race theory confirms the point that racism is embedded in the law,” as sociologist Victor Ray noted.

Some parents are worried about their kids learning things in school that they do not have the capacity to address. As a college professor who does teach CRT as one of the many theoretical frameworks that I bring into the classroom, students are alarmed by how little they have learned about inequality. They are upset at their schools, teachers, and even their parents. So, this is the conundrum: teachers in K-12 schools are not actually teaching CRT. But teachers are trying to respond to students asking them why people are protesting and why Black people are more likely to be killed by the police.

Ultimately, we cannot employ colorblind ideology in a society that is far from colorblind. Everyone sees it, whether they acknowledge it consciously or not. As I wrote in a previous Brookings article on whether the U.S. is a racist country, systemic racism can explain racial disparities in police killings, COVID-19, and the devaluing of homes in Black neighborhoods. If we love America, we should want it to be the best it can be. Rather than run from the issue of racism in America, we should confront it head on. Our kids and country will be better for it.

The “Ending Critical Race Theory in D.C. Public Schools Act,” introduced by a representative from Wisconsin, would ban certain concepts from being taught in D.C. public and charter schools.

The “Stop CRT Act” would withhold federal funding from schools and universities that promote “race-based theories.” The Senate passed an amendment to the budget resolution with Manchin’s support blocking federal funding from being used to teach CRT in pre-K and K-12 schools.

The “Protecting Students from Racial Hostility Act” would amend Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to make the teaching of “divisive concepts” discriminatory, establishes a system for reporting related complaints.",November 2021,Brookings Institution,race prejudice
17,Tolerating Intolerance in American Politics,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tolerating-intolerance-in-american-politics/,Peter Skerry,"In June 1943, Detroit was the scene of a two-day race riot that left nine whites and 25 African Americans dead. Commenting on those events, University of Chicago sociologist Robert Park wrote to a colleague: “I am not quite clear in my mind that I am opposed to race riots. The thing that I am opposed to is that the Negro should always lose.”

The continuing controversy in the San Fernando Valley between former Assemblyman Richard Katz and City Councilman Richard Alarcon over a contested state Senate seat is hardly of such tragic dimensions. Still, Park’s blunt realism is a useful antidote to the hand-wringing angst expressed in recent weeks over strained relations between Jews and Latinos. Park, the leading student of race and ethnic relations of his day, believed that competition and even conflict were inevitable stages in the process by which diverse groups learn to accommodate one another in modern societies.

Unlike Park, Americans today tend at first to deny or turn away from intergroup tensions. When we do finally face up to them, we interpret such tensions as the result of irrational prejudice and bigotry. We see them as aberrations, as the despicable excesses of those narrow-minded few who resist change and progress.

Park, on the other hand, viewed intergroup tensions, even animosities, as natural and inevitable. He saw competition and conflict as the quite rational clash of interests that emerge as groups jockey for position and advantage.

There are solid reasons for our contemporary perspective: Our national history has seen a good deal of irrational bigotry directed (Park reminds us) at a few groups that always tended to lose the competition—too often with their lives.

But we Americans have overreacted to this shameful history and high-mindedly decreed all group competition and conflict to be intolerable. Not all conflict is unjust, and certainly not all conflict is avoidable.

When my Irish Catholic forebears arrived in Boston a century ago, there is no doubt that they encountered unthinking, bigoted nativism. Yet as practicing Catholics pledged to obey the pope in Rome, they and their co-religionists did raise legitimate concerns as to their loyalty to their adopted home. When church leaders urged parents to opt out of the public schools and send their children to separate Catholic schools, such fears among Protestant Americans were understandably aggravated. Similarly during this period, when Mormons practiced polygamy and asserted, not unlike Catholics, that they practiced the one true religion, there were legitimate reasons for non-Mormons to be alarmed.

Did such concerns justify the burning of Catholic convents and the lynching of Mormons? Of course not. But an attentive reading of our ethnic and racial past should remind us that quite rational conflicts of interest and clashes of world views have been intertwined with even the most emotional and irrational intergroup battles. Attributing all such dissension to the unenlightened views of retrogrades may gratify those who consider themselves enlightened, but it does not help us to understand the complexities of intergroup relations. These relations are often messy and sometimes quite nasty. But such are the jostling and elbowing that arise among groups in a dynamic, competitive society.

An irony lost upon those who reduce all intergroup tensions to the struggle between the forces of light and darkness is that such tensions typically peak just when out groups are making their greatest strides. For example, Jews encountered the most thoroughgoing anti-Semitism in 19th century America after they had made the economic advances that allowed them to seek entry into social enclaves that until then had simply been beyond their means. Similarly, it is understandable, if regrettable, that Latinos encounter resistance today, when they are on the move politically. It would not surprise Park that tensions are emerging now between Latinos and their former Jewish allies. Nor would it surprise him that Latinos are finally getting mobilized politically because they have, since Proposition 187—a 1994 initiative that sought to deny public services to illegal immigrants—felt themselves to be under attack.

The philosopher William James, one of Park’s teachers, once remarked that “progress is a terrible thing.” Without for a moment excusing any of the political chicanery or vituperation indulged in by all parties in the San Fernando Valley, Angelenos need to face up to the fact that such excesses are to be expected in the struggle for advancement and power in this diverse and competitive society.

If we truly value diversity, then we will need to enlarge our concept of tolerance to include tolerance of contention and outright conflict. Alternatively, if we decide that we value consensus and social harmony more, then we should reexamine our preference for diversity. Our history tells us we can’t have it both ways.","July 19, 1998",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
18,Remembering when RNC delegates fought for racial justice,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/remembering-when-rnc-delegates-fought-for-racial-justice/,Vanessa Williamson,"Watching the 2020 Republican National Convention is an excruciating experience because it so clearly demonstrates the party’s decay into a slapdash monument to the president’s personal narcissism, undergirded by a fevered pep rally for white supremacist resentments. The RNC abandoned writing any policy platform in favor of a statement of “enthusiastic support” for the decisions of President Trump. Those speakers not directly related to the president described Trump in worshipful terms: “the defender of Western Civilization,” who would guide America on its “path to destiny.” The convention celebrated a white couple who pointed their guns at peaceful protestors and warned that Democrats wanted to “empty the prisons…and invite MS-13 to live next door.”

This spectacle is all the more painful when one remembers what the Republican Party once represented. Still occasionally described today as the party of Lincoln, the Republican Party was also the party of far more radical egalitarians. Rather than dwell further on the vitriol of the contemporary party, it is worth taking the time, at this moment, to recall Republican delegates of one hundred and fifty years ago, when the party was home to extraordinary fighters for racial justice.

A delegate to the Republican National Conventions of 1872 and 1876, Edwin Belcher was, as he put it, “born the slave of my father”—that is, the child of his enslaved mother and the white man who held her in bondage. When the Civil War began, he disguised his race so that he could join the U.S. Army, which had not yet opened military service to black men. He was twice wounded in combat, and spent months in a Confederate prison where, had his deception been discovered, he would have been killed or re-enslaved. After the war, Belcher became one of the early graduates of Howard Law School, helped establish the Republican Party in Georgia, and served in several public capacities including an agent of the Freedmen’s Bureau, a tax assessor, and a state representative. The end of Reconstruction brought an end to his career.

Stephen Atkins Swails represented South Carolina at the Republican National Convention in 1868, 1872, and 1876. He was a member of the famous 54th Massachusetts Infantry, and one of the first African Americans to be made an officer in the U.S. Army. A Northerner, Swails decided after the war to settle in South Carolina, where he practiced law, edited a newspaper, served as mayor, state senator, and as a member of the Electoral College. He was forced from office at the end of Reconstruction, after a white mob attempted to assassinate him. His grave in South Carolina was until recently unmarked.

A delegate to the 1868 Republican National Convention, Benjamin Franklin Randolph, was born to free black parents in Kentucky. He got his degree at Oberlin College and became an educator and then a chaplain in the Union army. After the war, he worked in the Freedmen’s Bureau to set up public schools in South Carolina. He was state senator and a delegate to the South Carolina Constitutional Convention, writing the state’s guarantee of public education and its equal protection clause. In October 1868, he was assassinated, in broad daylight and before witnesses, by members of the Ku Klux Klan. His murderers were never brought to justice.

Alongside more famous Republican delegates, like Frederick Douglass and Robert Smalls, Edwin Belcher, Stephen Swails, and B.F. Randolph strove to build an America that could overcome the sins of its founding. At the Republican conventions they participated in, speakers celebrated laying down “our prejudices of race and class,” committed the party to “crush out Ku Kluxism,” and swore to keep up the fight as long as “a single man in this land is deprived of one single, solitary right on account of his color.” They did not see victory fulfilled in their lifetimes, and their dream remains unfulfilled today.

Even after the Northern Republican Party abandoned its commitment to racial justice in the Reconstruction of the South, it was surely unforeseeable that the party would become the party of the “Southern Strategy,” its dog whistles growing louder until at last they were a blaring demagoguery. The trajectory of the Democratic Party would have seemed equally implausible: the party that defended slavery and imposed the racial apartheid of Jim Crow becoming a racially diverse coalition.

But, though the parties have reversed their positions, the fight is essentially the same: a struggle for multiracial democracy. As a new generation takes up the cause of racial justice, there is inspiration to be found in the Republican National Convention… of 1872.","August 26, 2020",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
19,Are We Born Prejudiced?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/are-we-born-prejudiced/,Ross A. Hammond,"In the March 17, 2007 edition of New Scientist magazine, Mark Buchanan wrote extensively on Hammond’s bringing to attention that humans have a deeply ingrained tendency to form groups. By better understanding what sorts of situations and environments are conducive to tolerance and empathy, he suggests that we may be able to promote better human nature.

In 1992, during the war between Serbia and Croatia, The Washington Post ran an interview with a Croatian farmer named Adem, who had a horrific story to tell. Over the previous year, Adem said, discourse between local Serbs and Croats had deteriorated, as individual identities dissolved into a menacing fog of “us” versus “them”. Then group animosity turned into something far worse. Serbs from a neighbouring village abruptly rounded up 35 men from Adem’s village and slit their throats. The summer before, the killers had helped their victims harvest their crops.

Earlier this year a small group of Z-list celebrities caused an international incident during the filming of the UK version of the reality TV show, Big Brother. The seemingly racist comments made by Jade Goody and her cronies to Bollywood film star Shilpa Shetty provoked thousands of shocked viewers to write letters of complaint. There was a media frenzy. Questions were asked in Parliament. Even the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, who happened to be on a visit to India, felt he had to comment on the affair.

Two very different stories; one common theme. Proof, if it were needed, that the human tendency to judge others in the crudest terms – race, religion, ethnicity, or any arbitrary marker – has not been consigned to the history books, no matter how much we might wish it were so. Somewhat disturbingly, scientists now suggest that this is not really surprising because such prejudice is part of human nature.

If they are correct, then the roots of group animosity and hatred run very deep indeed, which may be depressing news for those trying to make a difference in ethnic or sectarian hotspots from Darfur and Iraq to inner cities and football terraces. Yet researchers also insist that facing up to our authentic nature is the only way to gain real insight into the forces that drive group conflict, and to learn how we might manage and defuse such urges. “We shouldn’t treat prejudice as pathological just because it offends us,” says anthropologist Francisco Gil-White. “If we aim to transcend ethnic …","March 13, 2007",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
20,"Ability Grouping, Tracking, and How Schools Work",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/ability-grouping-tracking-and-how-schools-work/,Tom Loveless,"The 2013 Brown Center Report on American Education was released two weeks ago. One of the studies is on ability grouping. A key finding is that elementary teachers are using ability grouping again.  Ability grouping is the practice of dividing classes into small instructional groups, especially for teaching reading. According to data collected by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the frequency of ability grouping’s use in fourth grade reading instruction rose about two and a half times, from 28 percent in 1998 to 71 percent in 2009.

This year marks the 30th anniversary of the publication of How Schools Work by Rebecca Barr and Robert Dreeben, a book in which ability grouping plays an important role.  I became aware of the book at the University of Chicago in 1988 as a Ph.D. student. Robert Dreeben was my program advisor and dissertation chair.

Ability grouping is one method by which educators differentiate instruction. The term “differentiation” refers to the many ways that schools try to tailor different learning experiences to children’s varying levels of performance. In the 1980s, I earned a masters degree in special education and taught both learning handicapped and gifted students. Differentiation was in my blood when I arrived at Chicago.

Differentiation was also under fire. Ability grouping and tracking were becoming taboo. The popular research at that time, which was predominantly qualitative and impressionistic, condemned tracking and ability grouping for harming black, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students. This literature often depicted teachers as stupid or evil: stupid by robotically following tradition and unwittingly imposing harmful practices on students; evil by harboring race- or class-based prejudices that manifested in low expectations for many kids.

That is what made How Schools Work so refreshing. The book honors teachers in a profound way, not in a “you are all saints and we love you” way, but in a manner much more meaningful—by studying teachers’ work.  Barr and Dreeben followed a group of Chicago first grade teachers as they taught reading. A wealth of data was collected so that hypotheses could be tested empirically.  In How Schools Work, readers discover that first grade reading groups operate within a grand organizational scheme: groups nested in classrooms, classrooms housed within schools, schools situated within a big urban district. Seemingly routine tasks of teaching are transformed into thoughtful, important activities. Teachers do not appear to be stupid or evil. They appear to be professionals engaged in purposeful activities.

In 1988, “The Formation and Instruction of Ability Groups,” was published in the American Journal of Education. Adam Gamoran, a Chicago graduate student at the time, worked on the project producing this paper. Dreeben and Barr describe as “technological” the ways in which teachers form groups and then instruct them; not technological in the sense of using computers or electronic media but in the sense of applying craft knowledge in the pursuit of an occupational end, in this case, the goal of organizing a classroom full of first graders so that they can be taught how to read.

The notion that teaching is primarily intuitive (“teachers are born not made”) was directly refuted.  When they teach reading, teachers must juggle four inputs, each with its own constraints –student aptitude, the difficulty of reading materials, time devoted to instruction, and coverage of curriculum. The combination of these four inputs must be expertly managed to optimize learning. Sure, sometimes teachers have to fly by the seat of their pants while teaching, but for most of time, they employ craft knowledge to attain just the right mix. Kids do in fact learn how to read, and first grade, more than any other grade, is where that wonderful accomplishment can be observed while it happens.

Teachers aren’t perfect. They can make mistakes. They can form groups that are too large, too small, or too unwieldy in composition; move groups too fast or too slow; teach from a curriculum that is too demanding or too easy; or fail to provide enough time for instruction. They can also be unfair – even bigoted – but that’s not the norm.

It is heartening to note that as the use of ability grouping is increasing a new generation of researchers is bringing sophisticated statistical techniques (and open minds) to bear on questions involving both ability grouping and tracking. Tracking, the middle and high school practice of grouping students into separate classes as opposed to grouping students within a class, has always drawn the most scholarly attention. And the most opprobrium.

In a recent NBER working paper, Courtney A. Collins and Li Gan classify Dallas schools as sorted or non-sorted based on the heterogeneity of classes in math or reading achievement. The study also considers heterogeneity in the dispersion of students identified as gifted and talented, limited English speaking, or special education. Sorting is found to produce significantly positive effects in both reading and math — and for both high and low achievers. The researchers conclude:

This study has valuable policy implications because unlike many school policy variables, the composition of classes can often be changed with little need for increased funds. A school with a fixed number of classrooms and teachers can increase efficiency by rearranging students in the most effective way possible. This study suggests that creating classes with lower levels of dispersion of score or ability level may improve the achievement outcomes for students across the score distribution (Collins and Gan, 2013, page 20).

The study joins a long line of research dating back to at least the 1920s. The overriding concerns have been to determine whether tracking and ability grouping are good or bad (whether they produce positive effects) and whether they are equitable (even if some students benefit, is it at the expense of others). The evidence on these questions is mixed. To adequately summarize the literature would require a series of posts, and I will return to this topic in the future. The main point I would like to make in concluding this post pertains to the renewed popularity of tracking and ability grouping, not to whether either practice is warranted by research.

In the late 1980s and into the 1990s, powerful groups condemned ability grouping and tracking, among them, the National Governors Association, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Children’s Defense Fund. The use of ability grouping dropped significantly in the 1990s. Tracking in middle schools declined in all subjects but math.  According to the NAEP data reported in the Brown Center Report, ability grouping has made a strong comeback in the past decade.

The resurgence of ability grouping accentuates the need for new research questions. If educators are going to use ability grouping again, how should they employ this tool so as to maximize potential benefits and minimize potential harms? How large should groups be? How many groups should a teacher create, and how much time should be spent with each one? Do low achieving groups require more direct instruction than high achieving groups? How often should students be assessed and regrouped?  Are different curricula more effective with different groups? Notice the thrust of these inquiries. Such questions are directed towards producing new knowledge on the craft of teaching and to guide teachers in improving their practice, not towards the policy question of whether to group or not to group.

A fine example of this kind of study is provided by Carol McDonald Connor and colleagues at Florida State University. The researchers conducted a randomized field trial of software that organizes first grade reading instruction. The algorithm employed by the software considers each child’s entering skill level and progress made during the school year to recommend several dimensions of instruction, including assignment to small, homogenous ability groups, the amount of time spent on code- versus meaning-focused literacy, and teacher/child versus child-managed delivery. The targets for these recommendations are dynamic; that is, they change in response to periodic assessment of children’s progress. Children in the experimental classrooms gained about two months in reading achievement over those in the control group.

I hope the new generation of researchers will take up more questions like those in the FSU study. The debate over tracking and ability grouping has gone on for nearly a century. Research has not answered the key questions in dispute, at least not to the protagonists’ satisfaction. It’s time for some different questions. How should researchers proceed? A good place to start is reading How School’s Work. It’s just as fresh and illuminating today as when it was published thirty years ago.","April 3, 2013",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
21,Welcome Neighbors? New evidence on the possibility of stable racial integration,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/welcome-neighbors-new-evidence-on-the-possibility-of-stable-racial-integration/,Ingrid Gould Ellen,"The conventional wisdom on racial integration in the United States is that there are three kinds of neighborhoods: the all-white neighborhood, the all-black neighborhood, and the exceedingly rare, highly unstable, racially mixed neighborhood. The only real disagreement is about why so few neighborhoods are successfully integrated. Some attribute it to white discrimination pure and simple: whites, that is, have consciously and determinedly excluded blacks from their communities. Others contend that it is a matter of minority choice. Like Norwegians in Brooklyn’s Bay Ridge and Italians in Manhattan’s Little Italy, African Americans, they explain, prefer to live among their own kind. Finally, others maintain that segregation is driven mainly by income differences across racial groups. But almost all agree that when African Americans do manage to gain a foothold in a previously all-white community, the whites move away in droves—a phenomenon well known as “white flight.” Integration is no more than, in the words of Saul Alinsky, the “time between when the first black moves in and last white moves out.”

But while there is no denying that the United States remains a remarkably segregated country, such views are too pessimistic. Racially mixed neighborhoods are not as rare as people think. In 1990, according to nationwide census tract data, nearly 20 percent of all census tracts—which generally include a few thousand residents, roughly the size of the typical neighborhood—were racially integrated, defined as between 10 percent and 50 percent black. (Defining an “integrated” neighborhood is inevitably somewhat arbitrary. The 10-50 percent range takes into account both that African Americans make up just 12 percent of the total U.S. population and that most people consider integration to involve a fairly even racial split.) In 1990 more than 15 percent of the non-Hispanic white population and nearly one-third of the black population lived in these mixed neighborhoods. And the proportion is increasing. The number of households, both white and black, living in integrated communities grew markedly between 1970 and 1980 and even faster between 1980 and 1990. Most strikingly, the share of white residents living in overwhelmingly white census tracts—those in which blacks represent less than 1 percent of the total population—fell from 63 percent in 1970 to 36 percent in 1990.

Not only are racially mixed neighborhoods more numerous than people think, they are also more stable. An examination of a sample of 34 large U.S. metropolitan areas with significant black populations reveals that more than three quarters of the neighborhoods that were racially mixed in 1980 were still mixed in 1990. And in more than half, the share of non-Hispanic whites remained constant or grew. Most significantly, perhaps, a comparison with data from the 1970s suggests that neighborhoods are becoming more stable over time. The mean white population loss in integrated neighborhoods was lower in the 1980s than in the 1970s; a greater share of integrated tracts remained steady in the 1980s; and fewer tracts experienced dramatic white loss. In sum, neighborhood racial integration appears to be becoming both more widespread and more stable. Again, this is not to claim that America’s neighborhoods are no longer dramatically segregated. But it may no longer be accurate to describe them, as have some, as a system of “American Apartheid.”

How is it that certain neighborhoods seem to turn rapidly from white to black as soon as a few black households move in, while others hardly seem to change at all? The conventional account of racial mixing has, I think, discouraged people from seriously investigating this questionþeither by theorizing about what might be different about the more stable areas or by examining matters empirically. Because all mixed neighborhoods are presumed to be highly unstable, explaining the variance in the rate of racial change has hardly seemed pressing. But examining the conditions under which integration seems to thrive offers considerable insight not only into the causes of our nation’s racial segregation, but also into the prospects for mitigating it.

It is possible to devise a variety of theories to explain why some mixed neighborhoods remain integrated. One theory is simply that neighborhoods with fewer minority residents are more likely to be stable. The argument is that white households basically dislike living with minorities and that once the minority population of a given community reaches a concentration greater than they can tolerate, whites abandon the community, which quickly becomes all black. But while this argument has some intuitive appeal in light of our nation’s long history of racism, the degree of integration in a mixed community appears to have no bearing on its future racial mix. Whether a community is 10 percent black or 50 percent black, the likelihood of white loss is the same.

A second theory is that communities are more stable when black and white residents have similar incomes and education levels. This theory has an intuitive appeal to those who think that our country has gotten beyond race. But it is not borne out by the data either. Indeed, neighborhoods where blacks and whites are more equal in status are, if anything, less stable.

A third theory—and the one that best fits the evidence—is that residential decisions, especially those of white households, are indeed heavily shaped by negative racial attitudes. But it is not a simple matter of racial animus, of white households being unwilling to live, at any particular moment in time, in neighborhoods with moderately sized black populations. Rather, it is a matter of white households tending to assume that all mixed neighborhoods quickly and inevitably become predominantly black and being uncomfortable with the prospect of living in such an environment in the future.

As for the sources of this discomfort, I would emphasize two. First, whites may simply fear being “left behind” as a racial minority as the community becomes largely black. Second, and more important, white households (and potentially black households as well) may have negative preconceptions about what an all-black neighborhood will be like. Specifically, black neighbors may be thought to bring with them, or at least to portend, a deterioration in what Richard Taub and others have called the “structural position,” or strength, of a neighborhood: the aggregate of school quality, public safety, property values, and the like. In other words, white households may not necessarily dislike living next to blacks per se; but many white households, rightly or wrongly, associate blacks with decreasing structural strength. Whether such stereotyped associations should be distinguished from simple racial prejudice on moral grounds deserves lengthy discussion, but certainly they are analytically distinct and have distinct policy implications.

This proposed hypothesis—call it the “racial neighborhood stereotyping” hypothesis—generates some powerful predictions that can be tested empirically. First, it suggests that households who are less invested in the structural strength of the community—renters and households with no children, for instance—will be more open to racial mixing and thus more likely to live in mixed communities. Significantly, if whites simply dislike living near blacks, the opposite should hold true. For white renters—who can enter and exit neighborhoods more easily than homeowners—will be less likely to live in mixed communities.

Second, this hypothesis suggests that—contrary to the conventional view that racial transition is caused by “white flight”—racial concerns are more influential in decisions whether to move into a community than whether to move out. For residents of a community should be fully aware of its structural strength and therefore have less need to rely on race as a signal of this strength. Consequently, entry decisions should be far more important to racial change than exit decisions.

Third, racial mixing should be more stable in communities that seem sheltered in some way from further black growth (either because they are distant from the central area of black residence or because they have been racially stable in the past) or in which school quality, property values, and other neighborhood attributes seem particularly secure.

Using a unique census data set that links households to the neighborhoods in which they live, I have tested each of these predictions. The data generally bear them out. First, as predicted, households who are likely to be less invested in the structural strength of a neighborhood appear to be far more open to racial mixing. White households moving into racially mixed areas tend, for instance, to be younger than those opting for predominantly white areas. They also tend to be single rather than married and not to have children. Significantly, childless black households are similarly more open to increasingly black communities than their counterparts with children. Finally, white renters are considerably more willing to move into and remain in racially mixed areas than homeowners are. Thus, communities with relatively larger proportions of rental housing are more likely to remain integrated. Again, this finding runs counter to the pure-prejudice view of neighborhood choice, since renters can leave much more quickly than homeowners.

The data support the second prediction as well. Indeed, there is virtually no evidence of white flight or accelerated departure rates in the face of racial mixing. White households are no more likely to leave a community that is 80 percent black than one that is 2 percent black. And the moving decisions of black households appear insensitive to racial composition as well. Thus, to the extent that integrated neighborhoods do tip, or become increasingly black, entry decisions, rather than exit decisions, appear to be the cause. The point is, residents living in a community are far less likely to consider race as a signal of neighborhood quality than outsiders considering moving in.

As for the third prediction, the evidence confirms that mixed neighborhoods that seem sheltered from further black growth are more stable. In fact, the most crucial determinant of a community’s future course of racial change is its past racial stability. The longer a community has been integrated, the more likely it is to remain so. And analysis of individual decisionmaking confirms this. Controlling for present racial composition, white households are both less likely to leave a mixed community and more likely to enter one if its black population has been fairly steady in the past and thus seems likely to remain steady in the future. Moreover, integrated neighborhoods located farther from black inner-city communities are more likely to remain stable. Of course, the added distance may discourage blacks from entering these communities as quickly, but it seems likely that white expectations play a role too. For white households may view communities closer to the core black area as both more apt to gain black population and more vulnerable to the social dislocation that whites associate with such gain.

Furthermore, mixed neighborhoods in which the housing market is thriving and in which neighborhood amenities seem particularly secure are more likely to remain stable. For example, the data appear to show that communities with large stabilizing institutions, such as universities or military bases, that promise to provide a continual source of people, both white and black, who desire to live in the area provide just such strength and security.

To the extent the racial neighborhood stereotyping hypothesis is sound, the obvious question arises: what light does it shed on the moral and economic justification for government intervention to maintain mixed neighborhoods or to promote integration generally, and what kinds of policies would most effectively promote integration consistent with this justification? This is not the place to address such a grand question. Suffice it here simply to point out a few salient implications of the hypothesis for existing government policies designed to maintain mixed communities.

One policy that is occasionally used is the setting of an explicit quota on the number of blacks or minorities who may move into a particular mixed community or development where black or minority demand is high. For example, several years back, the owners of Starrett City, a large middle-income apartment complex in Brooklyn built with substantial government subsidies, set a quota on the number of blacks and Hispanics who could live there. In 1987 a federal court found that the quota violates the Fair Housing Act of 1968. But such quotas may also not make much sense as a matter of policy, since, as noted, no specified level of minority representation triggers white departure from a community.

Mixed communities have also tried to stem panic-selling by restricting realtors’ unsolicited efforts to encourage homeowners to sell and by banning the display of “For Sale” signs. But if exit decisions are less sensitive than entry decisions to racial composition and less critical to long-run stability, such strategies are poorly targeted. Integration, my results show, would be more effectively promoted by encouraging outsiders to move in, not discouraging insiders from leaving.

Some communities have tried to do just this. For example, some have tried to attract outsiders by public relations campaigns that advertise their particular strengths: their housing stock, their parks, their community solidarity. Such efforts also directly counter white households’ fears about the structural decline they associate with predominantly black neighborhoods.

Efforts in mixed communities to raise amenity levels also address white households’ fears of community decline. For example, programs to improve the appearance of a community—restoring local playgrounds, cleaning up commercial strips, repairing broken windows—can build social capital and bolster people’s faith in a neighborhoodþs strength.

Finally, the racial neighborhood stereotyping hypothesis has important implications for government policies that have nothing to do with promoting racial integration. For example, policies designed to increase homeownership, such as the homeowner mortgage interest deduction, may have the unintended consequence of exacerbating racial segregation.

The real story about Americaþs neighborhoods, though far from revealing anything close to a color-blind society, is less pessimistic and more dynamic than we have tended to believe. Integrated neighborhoods may be a minority, but their numbers are growing, and many appear likely to remain racially mixed for many years. Researchers must not overlook them. For the question of when and where households seem content to live in racially mixed environments is in many ways the flip side of the ultimate question of why our nation’s residential neighborhoods are as segregated as they are. And any progress toward answering the first question is progress toward answering the second. More important, white households should not overlook the facts either, for their overly pessimistic assumption that rapid racial transition is inevitable has helped, by its self-fulfilling nature, to undermine racial mixing.

In hindsight, the optimism of many people during the civil rights era that integration was just around the corner seems hopelessly naive. But the pessimism that has replaced it in recent years does not seem appropriate either. It seems based more on weariness in the face of an endlessly daunting challenge than on the facts, and it has, in my view, slowed our progress toward understanding neighborhood racial segregation.","December 1, 1997",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
22,Obama Ought to Take up Cricket,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/obama-ought-to-take-up-cricket/,Michael Fullilove,"Experts muse about whether Mr Obama will swing for the fences like President George W. Bush or play small ball like President Bill Clinton. Will he look to hit a home run on climate change or just try to make contact with the ball? Should he go after the Israeli-Palestinian issue early or let the first pitch go by – and can the president of the United States ever afford to let a pitch go by?

But baseball is President Bush’s game, not Mr Obama’s. If the new administration is going to achieve change we can believe in, a good start would be to junk the baseball references – not least because baseball is an exceedingly dangerous metaphor when it comes to foreign policy.

Mr Obama ought to take his lead from a more complex and demanding game than baseball. When it comes to foreign policy, he should take cricket as his text. There are seven lessons about the international system that Mr Obama could learn from cricket.

The first lesson derives from the fact that, like foreign policy, cricket is played outside the US. It is followed by perhaps one or two billion people. Unlike baseball’s World Series, cricket’s World Cup actually involves the world.

To succeed in cricket, you need to understand the different approaches of the various cricketing nations. After all, the cricketing world contains multitudes: an emerging great power, India; awkward powers such as Pakistan and rogue regimes such as Zimbabwe; fading imperial powers like the UK and regional metropoles such as South Africa. Rich countries such as Australia play cricket but so do poor countries such as Bangladesh. It is even played in Kenya, Mr Obama’s ancestral homeland. The International Cricket Council is located in the cockpit of geopolitics, the Persian Gulf.

Why does all this matter? Because the US needs to get much better at understanding other countries and cultures. With bloody conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, nuclear programmes in Iran and North Korea, a cooling economy and a warming planet, America can ill afford its usual self-absorption. Mr Obama needs to be deaf to the siren songs of protectionism and isolationism and alert to the voices (both the cheers and the jeers) of the world.

Second, as Americans often complain, cricket is a long game. A Test match often takes five days – and ends in a draw. Things are opaque in cricket, as in life: sometimes a draw can be a win. Cricket requires patience and discipline, which are not virtues we normally associate with the US. They were, however, on display during Mr Obama’s impressive campaign and they are exactly the qualities his administration will need in order to prevail in the war in Afghanistan.

Third, in the game of cricket, the condition of the pitch is critical. The ball usually bounces before it reaches the batsman, which introduces extra unpredictability into the contest. The ball does not just swing in the air, it turns off the seam. It can come at your head, not just your chest. In foreign policy, too, the decision-making environment is fast and fluid. It is difficult to see the choices before you, let alone make the right ones.

The invasion of Iraq demonstrated a baseball player’s mentality. Mr Bush thought he could fix all the problems of the Middle East at once: displace Saddam Hussein and the regimes around him would tumble like dominoes, tyranny would end, the Palestinians would make a deal, the price of oil would fall and the US would acquire new bases in the region. Perhaps if Mr Bush had coached a cricket team rather than owning a baseball franchise, he might have taken a different approach. He certainly would have understood that a match-winning innings is built over the course of many hours and hundreds of shots.

Fifth, the captain’s role is crucial. He sets the strategy and places the field. But he has to work through his players: he cannot deliver every ball and score every run. The captain is not the decider: he is first among equals. So it is with foreign policy, too. America’s allies and partners are tired of American unilateralism – but they are ready for American leadership.

Sixth, toughness has its place. Very few cricket matches are won through sweet reason alone. It is commendable that Mr Obama has cast aside Mr Bush’s prejudice against talking to America’s adversaries, but he needs to ensure those adversaries do not mistake his reasonableness for weakness. On the other hand, assertiveness comes in different forms – spin bowling as well as pace, forceful diplomacy as well as force.

Finally, the primacy of no cricket team is assured forever. Australia has dominated international cricket for the past decade through its brilliance, aggression and athleticism – but that period may now be coming to an end. The commonly heard claims of America’s decline are surely premature, yet nothing should be taken for granted. Much depends on the calibre of the new management in Washington.

There has been talk that Mr Obama may build a basketball court in the White House basement. He would be better off using the South Lawn as a cricket pitch.","December 10, 2008",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
23,Dropping the ball in Kirkuk,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/dropping-the-ball-in-kirkuk/,"Dror Michman, Yael Mizrahi-Arnaud","A few weeks ago, we were having our weekly Middle East “what if” hypothetical conversation with a colleague, regarding possible scenarios in Iraq following the Kurdish independence referendum. We agreed that the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) would have to settle for a symbolic victory without further action changing facts on the ground. We discussed possible Turkish and Iranian moves following the KRG’s announcement to put independence on hold, and the wild card of the disputed territories, mainly Kirkuk, and the challenges these would pose to Baghdad.

While there was little doubt Baghdad’s reaction would be fierce, we and our friend expressed confidence that since this was a dispute between two American allies, the Trump administration would keep the dispute under control, resolved through negotiations after the necessary Middle East muscles were flexed.

Following the recent events in Kirkuk, U.S. diplomacy failed to prevent a military confrontation between its two allies, the Iraqis and the Kurds, resulting in Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi’s reassertion of federal control over the disputed territories. While Tehran has gained the upper hand, Kirkuk’s loss is symbolic of America’s declining influence in Iraq, and poses grave implications for U.S. allies and the future of the region. It is receiving far more attention among regional security professionals than is apparent from reporting here in the United States. Iran’s ability to take the lead and have a prevailing influence on Iraqi moves is a watershed moment in the region, with implications all over the Middle East.

In past decades, American demands in such instances would carry a great deal of weight among its allies. Yet in this case, in America’s supposed “home court,” the attempt to assuage Baghdad’s reaction fell short of Iran’s heavyweight maneuvering, led by Qassem Suleimani, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s Quds Force, who persuaded al-Abadi not only to reject American demands for a tempered response, but also to allow the notorious Shiite-dominated PMF (Popular Mobilization Forces) to support the Iraqi military in retaking positions in Kirkuk and the disputed territories. Despite the murky details surrounding Suleimani’s coordination, it is clear that the Iranians asserted pressure on the PUK (Patriotic Union of Kurdistan) leadership sitting in Sulaymaniyeh and Kirkuk. This resulted in the PUK Peshmerga standing down, forcing the hand of the KDP Peshmerga into a largely unchallenged retreat.

While reports claim the United States tried to broker a deal between Erbil and Baghdad, the Americans obviously failed to impose any red lines and failed to steer both sides in the right direction—a highly unusual outcome when dealing with two American allies. Iran’s adroit maneuvering outrivaled America’s diplomatic efforts and allowed Iran to score a triple victory: further distancing the PUK from its Kurdish rival the KDP (Kurdish Democratic Party), re-energizing PMF ascendancy in Iraq, and demonstrating an effective level of influence over Baghdad.

Masoud Barzani’s decision to step down as president of the KRG signals the extent of Kurdish defeat. While the United States is currently facilitating negotiations between Baghdad and Erbil over key border crossings and other various issues, and a ceasefire appears to be holding, this could have been avoided had the United States taken a harder line from the start.

This failure is striking in light of America’s long-standing relationship: Both Iraqi Prime Minister al-Abadi and the Kurdish leadership (PUK and KDP) are close American allies with whom the United States has significant leverage. There are reasons to believe this debacle also took many other Middle Eastern players by surprise, and its implications have fallen on deaf ears, as far as Washington’s public discourse is concerned.

In the Kurdish camp, Barzani’s KDP feels betrayed once again by the United States. This perceived perfidy stings harsher in light of the U.S.-Kurdish alliance to defeat ISIS, with the Peshmerga working as America’s most effective ally fighting on the ground. Likewise, the PUK is likely reassessing its relationship with its U.S. ally.

In the Iraqi camp, certain leaders may have learned that playing with Iran is more beneficial, particularly in light of the April 2018 parliamentary elections. The various Sunni factions are also asking themselves, once again, how much to rely on American loyalty, accompanied by a growing level of frustration in the face of increasing Shiite influence over Baghdad. Sunni frustration over prejudicial power-sharing has proved crucial to Iraq’s tenuous unity and stability; upsetting this balance can quickly bubble over into chaos and radical insurgency.

All the while, neighboring Middle Eastern countries are keeping score. The message they are deciphering is one of a waning American determination or perhaps worse, an inability to play a major role in balancing or maintaining order in the area (apart from only one overriding goal: successfully defeating ISIS).

Iran’s natural interest in Iraq cannot be denied, due to their shared border and overlapping history. Nevertheless, Iran’s Shiite-centric narrative stokes sectarian animosity with proven lethal results. Iran’s direct confrontation with U.S. diplomatic efforts in Kirkuk should not be underestimated—conclusions Tehran draws from this episode could lead to an even more destructive level of interference in future U.S. interests in Iraq. While Washington’s strategic desire is for a unified Iraq under the leadership of al-Abadi, the handling of the Kirkuk crisis undermines this policy, as it increases both Kurdish and Sunni frustrations and proves that disputes are settled on the battlefield, rather than at the negotiating table. From indispensably mediating between factions on the ground, attempting to secure corridors across Iraq and Syria, and expanding the PMF’s role in securing vital territory, Iran’s goals and accomplishments are clear, while U.S. gains remain considerably more opaque.","November 3, 2017",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
24,"A Shift Looms: The President Sees Consensus, While Religious Leaders Disagree About the Church-State Divide",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-shift-looms-the-president-sees-consensus-while-religious-leaders-disagree-about-the-church-state-divide/,"E.J. Dionne, Jr.","Two of our leading presidential candidates, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Gore, are talking enthusiastically about what government can do to help “faith-based organizations” solve social problems. At a White House prayer breakfast with religious leaders last Tuesday, President Clinton embraced what he called “an emerging consensus about the ways in which faith organizations and our government can work together.” Pastors dealing with social problems are landing on the covers of national magazines and scholars are predicting a new “great awakening” of religious fervor in the country.

Not at all. But the turn of the millennium in America may well be remembered as a time when the country renegotiated the relationship between religion and public life, faith and culture. Don’t be scared by this: We are not about to chuck religious freedom, impose censorship or herd everyone into a church, synagogue or mosque. Indeed, it is partly because of advances in religious freedom—the result of court decisions and cultural changes that occurred during the 1960s—that it is even possible to talk about increased cooperation between the religious and governmental worlds.

There is no consensus yet on how church and state are supposed to work together, let alone how much. This is nothing new. Arguments for strong barriers between religion and government have waxed and waned through American history, for radically different reasons in different times.

Separation between church and state never meant that religion had no place in American life; remember, this is a nation that still stamps “In God We Trust” on its currency. But the rise of the religious conservatives and the culture wars of the past two decades sharpened the debate over separation and aroused both sides.

On the one side, religious conservatives decried the growing “secularization” of America and engaged in what sociologist Nathan Glazer has called a “defensive offensive” meant to restore the consensus on values that existed—or at least seemed to exist—before the ’60s. On the other, those dismayed by the religious right saw separation as a bulwark against the growing influence of organizations such as the Christian Coalition and the Moral Majority.

Many rank-and-file evangelical Christians found themselves as turned off as the rest of the country by polarization around political issues related to religion. “There’s a certain backlash against the shrill, partisan message they’ve heard,” Nathan Hatch, the provost at Notre Dame and a historian of evangelical Christianity, told a conference organized by the Ethics and Public Policy Center last week. “A lot of evangelicals are suburban people, and they much more easily identify with a George Bush than a Jerry Falwell or a Gary Bauer. They’re people of values. They’re also tolerant. There’s a sense that the attack mode is counterproductive.”

The church-state divide has often been cast as a fight between religious people and their secularist foes. But out of the public eye, there is a lively argument taking place among religious leaders themselves about the wisdom of allowing any breach of the church-state wall. There was once a time when the separation of church and state was a cardinal commandment of Southern Baptists and nearly all evangelical Protestants. For most of these Protestants, spending even a dime of public money on religious schools or church programs was to assail the Founders, destroy religious freedom and turn God into a servant of the state.

“Most people think church-state separationists are atheists or humanists or just bad people,” said Derek Davis, director of the J.M. Dawson Institute of Church-State Studies at Baylor University. “It’s just not that way at all.”

Davis’s center at Baylor, one of the country’s premier Baptist institutions, speaks for the old separationist tradition that still finds many adherents in the pews of Baptist churches. He offers useful reminders that the current argument over the role of religion in public institutions—especially in the public schools—has its roots early in American history. In 1844, he notes, six people were killed in a riot in Philadelphia over what version of the Ten Commandments should be posted in the public schools. Whatever one thinks of today’s battles over whether to post the Ten Commandments in government buildings, nothing that disturbing has happened yet.

If all evangelical Christians thought like the old-line Baptist separationists, Clinton and other politicians probably wouldn’t be talking so rapturously about a new relationship between church and state. But the culture wars changed the church-state argument by moving many Baptists and evangelicals to a new view: that separation was promoting secularism and turning once-friendly public institutions into environments hostile to religion. The Rev. Richard John Neuhaus captured this sense in his 1984 book, “The Naked Public Square.”

Thus, on church-state issues, says Richard Cizik, director of the Washington office of the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE), his organization has “really done a 180 [-degree turn]” over the past 40 years. Once opposed to state aid to religious schools, Cizik said, the NAE now supports private school vouchers and has endorsed the “charitable choice” provisions of the 1997 welfare bill promoting government aid to faith-based charities.

Earlier in our history, arguments over separation were just as fierce, but had different inspirations. When Catholic immigrants began flooding America from Ireland in the 1840s, there was strong Protestant opposition to any government assistance to the schools the Catholics were establishing. Here, separatism was less about protecting government or religion than in opposing any expansion of “Popery.”

Similar fights broke out from the late ’40s through the ’60s over government aid to parochial schools. Eleanor Roosevelt carried out a famous and bitter public argument with New York’s Cardinal Spellman on the issue.

“Certainly there’s been a regrettable history of animus toward Catholics,” says Melissa Rogers, associate general counsel at the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, whose group is separationist and spun off from Southern Baptist Convention after Baptist conservatives defeated moderates and liberals.

Davis agrees that separatism was often “fueled by this anti-Catholic bias.” But both Davis and Rogers insist that anti-Catholicism was less important historically to separationists than a general fear of the effect of state involvement in religion on both government and the religious institutions themselves.

What’s striking now is that conservative Protestants who long opposed aid to Catholic schools now find themselves allied with Catholics on the voucher issue. “One of the most remarkable changes of the 20th century is the virtual evaporation of hostility between Protestants and Catholics,” says Grant Wacker, a professor of religious history at Duke University Divinity School. “I don’t think it’s because Baptists have come to have a great respect for Tridentine theology. It’s because they see Catholics as allies against graver problems. There’s a large reconfiguration going on now.”

Indeed. In the separationist wars, Baptists find themselves allied with Jews and many mainline Protestant churches. But even more relevant are liberal/conservative splits within the denominations and faiths themselves. On some church/state questions, Reform Jews are on the opposite side from Orthodox Jews. In the Christian churches, liberals and conservatives (or, as some would have it, modernists and traditionalists) ally against each other across denominational lines, creating a new politics.

What sense can be made of this, and in particular of the turn toward faith-based institutions? Is a new national consensus on church-state questions possible?

A consensus is possible—even if it will be hard to achieve—if the current arguments are understood as the third stage in a long national debate.

White Protestant hegemony in America—the first stage—began to erode with the end of Prohibition, arguably the last political project to unite mainline and fundamentalist Protestants. But the formal dominance of Protestantism was largely repealed in the 1960s, often with the strong support of progressive Protestants themselves.

The second stage involved a hard push for separation, including many of the relevant court decisions. It was no accident that this occurred as the country was coming to terms with its historic treatment of minorities. “I see the ’60s as a time when we began to grow up a little bit,” says Davis, director of the Baylor center. “If we want to be a democracy that supports the rights of minority groups, including religious minorities, we can’t have a government that stands behind and supports one world view.”

John F. Kennedy’s election as president marked the full entry of Roman Catholics into the mainstream of American life. The civil rights movement sought to right historic wrongs done to African Americans. The era swept away long-standing barriers to Jews, the effective end of restrictive covenants and new movements to defend the rights of Latinos and Asians. All brought the pervasively white and Protestant ethos in government-financed institutions and society into question.

Today’s commotion is rooted in a new fear—that the combination of legal decisions and cultural trends has marginalized religion more than is either necessary for religious freedom or desirable for the country. In creating what Yale Law School professor Stephen Carter called “The Culture of Disbelief” in his book of that title, the country seemed to replace old prejudices (of race and religion) with a new prejudice against belief itself.

The current renegotiation of boundaries—the third stage—has already borne fruit. In 1995, new federal guidelines to school administrators were designed to make clear that while the state cannot impose religion, students cannot be forced to be secular against their will or silenced in their personal expressions of religion. Individual students could not be stopped from praying, Jewish students could not be barred from wearing skull caps, any kid who wanted to talk about religion on school grounds had the right to do so. As the president said at the time, the Constitution “does not require children to leave their religion at the schoolhouse door.”

In 1997, the administration issued guidelines requiring government supervisors to respect individual expressions of faith by religious employees. Christians, the guidelines said, can keep Bibles on their desks, Muslim women can wear head scarves, Jewish workers should be accommodated as much as possible in scheduling so they can honor the High Holidays. This may all seem like common sense, but it reflects an awareness that a desire to preserve religious freedom entails both keeping the government out of the way and protecting the free expression of believers.

The battle over expanded government aid to faith-based institutions will not be so easy. Rogers calls it “the wrong way to do right.” She means that the admirable efforts by faith-based charities should get much more private and corporate support, but not government help. Yet Gore’s endorsement of what has come to be known as “charitable choice” suggests a slow shifting of the boundaries being drawn by moderate and even liberal Democrats who have come to see the churches as indispensable allies to government in solving problems.

The NAE’s Cizik thinks the rise of religious feeling in America and a decline in the hostility to religious institutions may be a sign that “a new, more acceptable consensus would replace partisan religious fights.” Even active participants in the culture wars, he says, are tired of them.

Amen to that. And if a new consensus still involves some contention, that’s neither surprising or disappointing. What else do you expect in a country where people have rioted over the Ten Commandments? But somehow, precisely because every generation has been willing to argue about it, we have managed to preserve religious liberty.","October 3, 1999",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
25,How a Minneapolis public history project is building political will to redress racial housing disparities,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-a-minneapolis-public-history-project-is-building-political-will-to-redress-racial-housing-disparities/,"Kirsten Delegard, Danya Leebaw","Before Minneapolis became the epicenter of an international movement for racial reckoning, its residents faced the kind of everyday racial injustices that rarely make headlines. The Twin Cities metro area, for instance, has the largest racial homeownership gap in the country. While 70% of white families own their homes, only 21% of Black families can say the same. Our metro area’s racialized housing crisis has been the subject of research reports for decades, but little has changed.

To highlight the deeply rooted causes behind these disparities, in 2019, the University of Minnesota Libraries hosted the premiere of “Jim Crow of the North,” a film that tells the story of how racial covenants came to Minneapolis in the 20th century and why these racist restrictions laid the foundation for contemporary housing inequities. Filmmaker Daniel Bergin chose this location for the debut because since 2016, we had been the incubator for an experiment aimed at building political will to address racial housing inequities: Mapping Prejudice, which the film also followed the origins of. Mapping Prejudice mobilizes community members to identify racial covenants and visualize their lasting impact on the city’s physical landscape.

In this piece, we highlight how academic libraries can foster new spaces for dialogue around racial justice and housing access through community-centered projects like Mapping Prejudice, while also leveraging their resources, data, and community connections to translate this dialogue into action.

Mapping prejudice mobilizes volunteers to visualize the hidden histories of race and privilege in the built environment. It was inspired by and builds upon similar work in Seattle and Virginia that uses digital mapping to draw linkages between past policies and contemporary racial disparities.

By engaging community members in the creation of a dataset and data visualizations of racist housing deeds, Mapping Prejudice has helped thousands of people see up close what Ibram X. Kendi calls the “racism behind those racial disparities.” Our analysis has drawn new attention not only to the lasting effects of residential racial segregation in Minneapolis, but also to how race has shaped public space in the city—with some of the city’s best parks located in residential districts that barred people of color from living there.

Over the years, these visual representations have helped residents make meaning of historical data and foster new understandings of how racial segregation was established in Minneapolis, how race shaped housing access, and how wealth is transferred from one generation to another through property ownership.

Our academic colleagues as well as the broader public are often curious about why Mapping Prejudice’s institutional home is in an academic library. To us, the library makes perfect sense for a justice-oriented public history project like this because of its values and aspirations, even if the gap between these and reality can be significant and problematic. Libraries are committed to openness and collaboration, while public historians are driven to listen and co-create with the community.

Last year, we received transformational funding to usher in the next, crucial phase of Mapping Prejudice: Mapping Trust: A model for co-creative community collaboration in an academic library. With support from the Mellon Foundation, Mapping Trust will create a think tank within the library to nurture conversations—with the voices of Black, Indigenous, and people of color at the center—around dismantling structural racism and developing mutually beneficial collaborations to launch community projects with the same aim.

The Mapping Trust project involves hiring a new full-time community engagement lead and recruiting six community engagement fellows from around the Twin Cities, for work that will begin this summer. This is the first program of its kind in an academic library, although it is aligned with other movements at the University of Minnesota and beyond to bridge the gap between the academy and the surrounding community. The community engagement lead and fellows will have access to resources and support from the project team, the libraries, and the university to pursue meaningful projects with the Mapping Prejudice data for their own smaller communities.

With Mapping Trust, the hope is that the University of Minnesota Libraries can help lead a movement through which an academic library can enact its stated values of being open, serving the public good, and working for social change.","May 11, 2022",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
26,Detecting and mitigating bias in natural language processing,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/detecting-and-mitigating-bias-in-natural-language-processing/,Aylin Caliskan,"Unsupervised artificial intelligence (AI) models that automatically discover hidden patterns in natural language datasets capture linguistic regularities that reflect human biases, such as racism, sexism, and ableism.1 These unsupervised AI models, namely word embeddings, provide the foundational, general-purpose, numeric representation of language for machines to process textual data.

Word embeddings identify the hidden patterns in word co-occurrence statistics of language corpora, which include grammatical and semantic information as well as human-like biases. Consequently, when word embeddings are used in natural language processing (NLP), they propagate bias to supervised downstream applications contributing to biased decisions that reflect the data’s statistical patterns. These downstream applications perform tasks such as information retrieval, text generation, machine translation, text summarization, and web search, in addition to consequential decision-making during resume screening for job candidate selection, university admissions automation, or essay grading. Word embeddings play a significant role in shaping the information sphere and can aid in making consequential inferences about individuals. Job interviews, university admissions, essay scores, content moderation, and many more decision-making processes that we might not be aware of increasingly depend on these NLP models.

Billions of people using the internet every day are exposed to biased word embeddings. However, no regulation is in place to audit these AI technologies that pose potential threats to equity, justice, and democracy. As a result, there is an urgent need for regulatory mechanisms, a diverse AI ethics workforce, and technical approaches to prevent AI technologies from accelerating its harmful side-effects.2

Amazon’s automated resume screening for selecting the top job candidates turned out to be discriminating against women in 2015.3 Amazon used resume samples of job candidates from a 10-year period to train its recruitment models. This supervised downstream NLP application learned how to score candidates by computing the patterns in previous resume samples from Amazon and respective information regarding the success level of the job candidate. As a result, the trained model learned the historical trends associated with employment at Amazon by discovering linguistic patterns on resumes. Women were underrepresented in the training set collected from employees. Consequently, the resume screening model associated men and the linguistic signals on their resumes with successful employment at Amazon, whereas resumes of candidates which contained words associated with women were frequently discarded by the algorithm. The biased patterns learned by the model led to discrimination against female job candidates. Amazon soon abandoned the automated recruitment tool after they discovered the bias.

NLP applications’ biased decisions not only perpetuate historical biases and injustices, but potentially amplify existing biases at an unprecedented scale and speed. Future generations of word embeddings are trained on textual data collected from online media sources that include the biased outcomes of NLP applications, information influence operations, and political advertisements from across the web. Consequently, training AI models on both naturally and artificially biased language data creates an AI bias cycle that affects critical decisions made about humans, societies, and governments.

AI and NLP technologies are not standardized or regulated, despite being used in critical real-world applications. Technology companies that develop cutting edge AI have become disproportionately powerful with the data they collect from billions of internet users. These datasets are being used to develop AI algorithms and train models that shape the future of both technology and society. AI companies deploy these systems to incorporate into their own platforms, in addition to developing systems that they also sell to governments or offer as commercial services.

With the lack of regulation and readily available bias auditing mechanisms, AI companies have not provided transparency in the everyday effects of the algorithms that they deploy in society. For example, Google’s machine translation algorithms convert the gender-neutral Turkish sentences “O bir profesör. O bir öğretmen” to the English sentences “He’s a professor. She is a teacher.” Facebook ran human subject experiments on its platform to study how to manipulate users’ emotions via biased text that induces associations of unpleasantness.4

Social media platforms automatically decide which users should be exposed to certain types of content present in political advertisements and information influence operations, based on personality characteristics predicted from their data.5 As researchers identify and measure the harmful side effects of NLP algorithms that incorporate biased models of language, regulation of algorithms and AI models can help alleviate the harmful downstream impacts of large-scale AI technologies.

In 2017, at Princeton University’s Center for Information Technology Policy, Joanna Bryson, Arvind Narayanan, and I developed methods demonstrating that word embeddings learn human-like biases from word co-occurrence statistics.6 When words representing concepts appear frequently with certain attributes, word embeddings learn to associate the concept with the co-occurring attributes. For example, sentences that contain words related to kitchen or arts tend to contain words related to women. However, sentences that contain career, science, and technology terms tend to contain words related to men. As a result, when machines are processing language to learn word embeddings, women, as a social group, appear in close proximity to words like family and arts relative to men; whereas, men, as a social group, appear in close proximity to career, science, and technology. We found that stereotypical associations exist for gender, race, age, and intersections among these characteristics. When these stereotypical associations propagate to downstream applications that present information on the internet or make consequential decisions about individuals, they disadvantage minority and underrepresented group members. As long as language corpora used to train NLP models contain biases, word embeddings will keep replicating historical injustices in downstream applications unless effective regulatory practices are implemented to deal with bias.

Studying biases in widely used word embeddings trained on a corpus of 800 billion words collected from the web reveals that names of African Americans tend to co-occur with unpleasant words. Measuring the relative association of names of African Americans vs. names of white people with pleasant and unpleasant words shows that the word embeddings contain negative associations for the concept of an African American social group due to the biased depiction of the group on the internet.7 These types of associations that reflect negative attitudes toward one social group are considered harmful and prejudiced. Similar negative associations are reflected for the elderly and people with disabilities. And women are often associated with family and literature, whereas men are associated with career and science. It is also worth noting that state-of-the-art language models generally capture the stereotypes and biases present in American culture, even though these NLP technologies are employed across the world.","May 10, 2021",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
27,What’s So Hard About Regulating Supreme Court Justices’ Ethics? — A Lot,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/whats-so-hard-about-regulating-supreme-court-justices-ethics-a-lot/,Russell Wheeler,"The Supreme Court’s decision to hear a challenge to the health care law is renewing calls for recusal, described here and here and here. Some, mainly Democrats, charge that Justice Thomas (and his wife) have been too close to some of the law’s strongest critics. Others, mainly Republicans, charge that as solicitor general Justice Kagan may have had even a limited role as the administration crafted the law’s defense. There are no signs that either justice will sit out the case.

These recusal demands are mostly tactics to try to influence who decides the case or delegitimize the decision, but they reflect a growing debate over whether the justices’ ethics need more regulation to avoid conflicts of interest, or their appearance. With Gallup reporting the Court’s approval rating at 46 percent, second lowest since 2000, it’s a debate worth having.

The problem is not that federal judicial ethics provisions only apply to lower federal court judges— a common but erroneous claim. The problem—unsolved so far—is creating mechanisms to regulate the justices’ behavior that don’t create more problems than they might solve. Some proposals, for example, would suck other federal judges into partisan battles over Supreme Court recusals. In this short piece I try to summarize the principal sources of federal judicial ethics regulations and their relation to the justices—about which confusion abounds—analyze the possible impact of proposals to tighten ethical constraints on them, and comment on what the justices themselves might do.

The disqualification statute binds federal judges and justices alike, as do several ethics-in-government law provisions, including a financial disclosure requirement. The United States Judicial Conference directs its advisory Code of Conduct to judges, but at least some justices have said they also seek its guidance. The Judicial Conduct Act provides for the disposition of complaints about all federal judges except the justices; the Act, contrary to what many assume, is not simply a Code of Conduct enforcement mechanism.

Agencies in the judiciary apply these provisions: the courts in their judicial capacity; the Judicial Conference—26 circuit and district judges, chaired by the chief justice—which provides administrative direction to federal courts other than the Supreme Court; and the judicial councils in the twelve regional circuits.

This statute directs “[a]ny justice [or] judge . . . [to] disqualify himself [sic] in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” and in specific, listed situations—such as owning even one share of stock in a party to the litigation. Recusal may come on motion of one of the parties or, even without a motion, when the judge or justice learns of a conflict.

Enforcement is through appellate review by the courts, in their judicial capacity. Litigants sometimes ask judges to recuse themselves at the outset of a case and might seek a mandamus order from a higher court if the judge declines. Or, litigants who lost a case may ask an appellate court to vacate the decision, claiming that the judge sat on the case despite a recusal-requiring conflict of interest.

But the appellate process doesn’t work as to Supreme Court justices because there’s no higher court to hear the appeal. A bill introduced last March would tell the Judicial Conference to create such a court—of sitting or retired judges or justices—to hear appeals from unsuccessful recusal motions and “decide whether the justice . . . should be so disqualified.” (HR 862, introduced in March, has 32 sponsors and cosponsors; 43 members have called for House Judiciary Committee hearings.)

Such a court of lower court judges would most likely violate the Constitution’s “one Supreme Court” mandate. Some have argued that a justices-only court would not. Chief Justice Hughes, however, in challenging FDR’s 1937 proposal to add justices to the Court, objected to the idea that the Court could sit in divisions if the extra justices made it too large to sit as a single body. The “Constitution,” he said, “does not appear to authorize two or more Supreme Courts or two or more parts of a Supreme Court functioning in effect as separate courts.” Hughes took flak for issuing an advisory opinion, but his warning has relevance to HR862’s proposed court.

More important, consider the practical problems were HR 862’s court to survive a constitutional challenge: In the first place, only parties to a litigation may move for a recusal, and Supreme Court litigants rarely do. (There have apparently been no motions requesting recusals in the health care case.) So the bill would not produce much action to solve whatever problems worry proponents.

But when a party moved for recusal and the justice declined, the HR 862 court would have to balance the motion against what some see as a judge’s “duty to sit,” discussed briefly here. Because a recused justice cannot be replaced by another judge, the prospects increase for a four-four decision, which would leave the matter at issue without a national resolution. It’s one thing for the justices to balance those considerations, but quite another for lower court judges on the HR 862 court to do it for them. And, finally, suppose a party sought recusal and the HR 862 court denied an appeal when a justice declined to do so, but, after the decision, additional evidence of a possible conflict emerged. Could the party renew the recusal motion before the special court, trying to get the decision vacated and, in the process, adding a new complication to constitutional adjudication?

The Ethics in Government Act limits the outside income and employment of those whom the Act covers (including the justices), as well as the gifts they may accept. Congress authorized the Judicial Conference to issue implementing regulations for those in the judicial branch (available at the links above), and the Conference has delegated to the Chief Justice its authority to issue such regulations for the Court.[1] Common Cause paraphrases a letter from a Court official stating that the justices have agreed by resolution to abide by the Conference regulations.

When Justices Breyer and Scalia testified at recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on “the role of judges,” however, a senator said the justices and Court employees are the only federal workers “who are exempt from the[ ] restrictions” on “receiving certain gifts and outside income under the Ethics Reform Act of 1989” and asked should “the Supreme Court . . . be required by law to follow the same financial restrictions as everyone else in government.” Rather than point out the error in the question, Justice Breyer instead described the justices’ compliance with a different statute, the financial disclosure law.

An Ethics in Government Act provision requires all high-salaried government employees to file annual financial reports. Justices and judges file them with a Judicial Conference committee (apparently the only instance of the Conference’s exercising administrative jurisdiction over the justices). The statute also directs the report-receiving agencies to refer to the attorney general anyone whom they have “reasonable cause to believe has … willfully failed to file information required to be reported.” The attorney general may initiate a civil action, seeking a civil penalty.

Common Cause and the Alliance for Justice in September petitioned the Conference to investigate whether to refer Justice Thomas for his since-corrected failure to report his wife’s well-known employment by conservative policy groups, and his possible error in not reporting certain travel expenses. Some House Democrats made the same request after the administration asked the Court to take up the health care law.

The Conference will likely conclude that even though the disclosure forms are not very complicated for those with no or modest investments (I know from my own experience), honest mistakes do occur, which fall short of the statute’s “willfully failed” standard.

Consider, though, the precedent a referral would create. Encouraging a group of lower court judges to refer a justice to the attorney general for civil prosecution creates the potential for sucking them into the partisan skirmishes over the Court. And the attorney general hardly needs the headache of deciding whether to pursue a civil action against a justice.

The Judicial Conference’s Code of Conduct, in the Code’s words, “applies to” judges on courts in the Conference’s administrative ambit, which doesn’t include the Supreme Court. However, Justice Kennedy told a House appropriations subcommittee hearing that the Code “appl[ies] to the justices in the sense that . . . by resolution we’ve agreed to be bound by them.” It’s unclear, however, whether the justices actually adopted such a resolution, or whether some or all of them simply “go to those volumes”, as Justice Breyer said he does, “[w]hen I find a difficult question.” As noted earlier, Common Cause has said a Court official told it that the resolution at issue involves not the Code but instead the Conference regulations that implement some of the ethics in government act provisions for lower court judges.

In any event critics say that “voluntary compliance . . . isn’t enough.” The justices, editorialized the New York Times, “must adopt the rigorous code of conduct that applies to all other parts of the federal judiciary.” But “applies to” as the Code uses the phrase, doesn’t mean “binds,” the verb commonly used by editorial writers and others in describing the Code. The Code says that it “provide[s] guidance to judges;” the Conference’s Codes of Conduct Committee chair said that the Code is “advisory and aspirational”. Nevertheless, HR862 (see above) would have the Code “apply to the justices… to the same extent as [it] applies to circuit and district judges.” The bill’s sponsors are apparently unaware that it would make the justices’ compliance what it is now—voluntary.

And the Code isn’t “rigorous.” It says itself that many of its provisions “are necessarily cast in general terms.” For example, it tells judges to “discourage a party from requiring the judge to testify as a character witness except in unusual circumstances when the demands of justice require,” but it can’t spell out how much “discouraging” is sufficient or when the “demands of justice” require an exception.

Judges do, though, look to the Code for guidance—almost all judges want to do the right thing, and the right thing is not always obvious. The Codes of Conduct Committee provides judges advisory opinions on whether a contemplated action would be consistent with the Code. And, Justice Kennedy told the budget hearing, “We can ask for advice from the committee …. And we do ask for that.”

This law authorizes “[a]ny person” to file a complaint alleging that a federal judge—but not a justice—“has engaged in conduct prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts.” Chief circuit judges dismiss most complaints as unsubstantiated or rearguing the merits of a case; the circuit judicial councils decide the handful that remain (with right of appeal to the Conference).

Enforcing the Code of Conduct is not the Act’s principal purpose. The Conference’s implementing rules say that while the Code may be “informative” and some activities covered by the Code “may constitute misconduct,” “determining what constitutes misconduct under the statute is the province” of the councils, subject to the Act and the Conference’s rules.[2]

Nonetheless, HR 862 would direct the Conference to investigate “complaints . . . that a justice . . . has violated the Code of Conduct,” and to take “appropriate” action, using procedures “modeled after” the Judicial Conduct Act. Thus, were Congress to enact HR 862, the federal judiciary’s disciplinary mechanisms would have two overlapping standards: the “conduct prejudicial” standard as the councils interpret it for lower-court judges and, the Code of Conduct as the Conference interprets it for the justices.

Apart from that problem, consider the impracticality of having lower court judges decide what behavior by justices isn’t acceptable and what to do about it. The Judicial Conduct Act authorizes councils to suspend a judge’s case assignments. A Conference order telling a justice to sit out a few cases could create a constitutional crisis.

Given the Supreme Court’s visibility, and use of ethics charges to try to influence or delegitimize decisions, the Conference likely would be flooded with complaints, almost none of them meritorious. The high dismissal rate would breed more cynicism, and perhaps stoke unjustified legislative antagonism. And, while it’s highly unlikely that lower court judges would take any action against members of the Supreme Court—why pull those judges into partisan recusal battles over the Supreme Court?

The absence of formal review mechanisms for justices’ ethical decisions is a necessary imperfection in the system. The frustration behind recent proposals to establish such mechanisms is understandable, but those proposals would likely create more problems than they would solve.

The states use judicial conduct or performance commissions (judges are in the minority in most of them) to hear some complaints about state judges, including state supreme court members. There has been little interest in that at the federal level, just as there has been little interest in having federal judges stand for election. The states, more than the federal system, generally tip the judicial independence-accountability balance more toward accountability. Since the framing of the Constitution, the federal system has tipped the balance more toward independence, but that doesn’t deny the importance of accountability.

We rely on the justices to make decisions about their ethical matters in part because the buck has to stop somewhere and in part because we trust them to make those decisions in good faith. That doesn’t mean every decision a justice makes is beyond legitimate criticism or that their decisions never merit an explanation. The Code of Conduct soundly advises judges, and by extension justices, that they “must expect to be the subject of constant public scrutiny and accept freely and willingly restrictions that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen.” Several suggestions:

Few believe the activities currently being cited as grounds for recusals in the health care case will have any influences on any justice’s vote, but appearances matter. Recusal tactics may be inevitable when the courts are front-and-center in disputes over contentious policy issues. The justices should take what steps they can to avoid making things worse.","November 28, 2011",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
28,An AI fair lending policy agenda for the federal financial regulators,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/an-ai-fair-lending-policy-agenda-for-the-federal-financial-regulators/,"Michael Akinwumi, John Merrill","Algorithms, including artificial intelligence and machine learning models (AI/ML), increasingly dictate many core aspects of everyday life. Whether applying for a job or a loan, renting an apartment, or seeking insurance coverage, AI-powered statistical models decide who will have access to the foundational drivers of opportunity and equality.1

These models present both great promise and great risk. They can minimize human subjectivity and bias, facilitate more consistent outcomes, increase efficiencies, and generate more accurate decisions. Properly conceived and managed, algorithmic, and AI-based systems can be opportunity-expanding. At the same time, a variety of factors—including data limitations, lack of diversity in the technology field, and a long history of systemic inequality in America—mean that algorithmic decisions can perpetuate discrimination against historically underserved groups, such as people of color and women.

In light of the growing adoption of AI/ML, federal regulators—including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Federal Reserve), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)—have been evaluating how existing laws, regulations, and guidance should be updated to account for the advent of AI in consumer finance. Earlier this year some of these regulators issued a request for information on financial institutions’ use of AI and machine learning in the areas of fair lending, cybersecurity, risk management, credit decisions, and other areas.2

The adoption of responsible AI/ML policies will continue to receive serious attention from regulators. This paper proposes policy and enforcement steps regulators can take to ensure AI/ML is harnessed to advance financial inclusion and fairness. As many other papers have already focused on methods for embracing the benefits of AI, we focus here on providing recommendations to regulators on how to identify and control for the risks in order to build an equitable market.

For decades, lenders have used models and algorithms to make credit-related decisions, the most obvious examples being credit underwriting and pricing. Today, models are ubiquitous in consumer markets and are constantly being applied in new ways, such as marketing, customer relations, servicing, and default management. Lenders also commonly rely on models and modeled variables provided by third-party vendors.

Recent increases in computing power and exponential growth in available data have spurred the advancement of even more sophisticated statistical techniques. In particular, entities are increasingly using AI/ML, which involves exposing sophisticated algorithms to historical “training” data to discover complex correlations or relationships between variables in a dataset.  The set of discovered relationships—typically referred to as a “model”—is then run against real-world information to predict future outcomes.

In the consumer finance context, AI/ML is similar to traditional forms of statistical analysis in that both are used to identify patterns in historical data to draw inferences and future behavior.  What makes AI/ML unique is the ability to analyze much larger amounts of data and discover complex relationships between numerous data points that would normally go undetected by traditional statistical analysis. AI/ML tools are also capable of adapting to new information—or “learning”—without human intervention. These tools are becoming increasingly popular in both the private and public sectors. As two United States senators recently put it, “algorithms are increasingly embedded into every aspect of modern society.”3

While AI/ML models offer benefits, they also have the potential to perpetuate, amplify, and accelerate historical patterns of discrimination. For centuries, laws and policies enacted to create land, housing, and credit opportunities were race-based, denying critical opportunities to Black, Latino, Asian, and Native American individuals. Despite our founding principles of liberty and justice for all, these policies were developed and implemented in a racially discriminatory manner. Federal laws and policies created residential segregation, the dual credit market, institutionalized redlining, and other structural barriers. Families that received opportunities through prior federal investments in housing are some of America’s most economically secure citizens. For them, the nation’s housing policies served as a foundation of their financial stability and the pathway to future progress. Those who did not benefit from equitable federal investments in housing continue to be excluded.

Algorithmic systems often have disproportionately negative effects on people and communities of color, particularly with respect to credit, because they reflect the dual credit market that resulted from our country’s long history of discrimination.4 This risk is heightened by the aspects of AI/ML models that make them unique: the ability to use vast amounts of data, the ability to discover complex relationships between seemingly unrelated variables, and the fact that it can be difficult or impossible to understand how these models reach conclusions. Because models are trained on historical data that reflect and detect existing discriminatory patterns or biases, their outputs will reflect and perpetuate those same problems.5","December 2, 2021",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
29,Black-white mixed race identity rises in the South,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/black-white-mixed-race-identity-rises-in-the-south/,William H. Frey,"As shown in my book, “Diversity Explosion,” the growth of black-white marriages in the United States is unmistakable, as are the gains in the population that identifies itself as “white and black,” particularly among the very young. As further evidence that the white-black divide is eroding, it is useful to look at the region most historically resistant to change: the South. Because of past prejudices and customs, the white-black population, as a percentage of all blacks, is still considerably lower in Southern states than in other parts of the country (see map). In a slew of states leading from Maryland to Texas, “white and black” populations represent less than 5 percent of the black-only populations. In Mississippi and Louisiana, “white and black” populations constitute only 1 percent. These figures compare with more than 20 percent of “white and black” persons in a handful of states with sparse black populations in the West, Great Plains, and New England.

Yet, the South is attracting blacks in large numbers, including multiracial blacks, from all parts of the country. Thus, it is significant that when states are ranked by the growth rates in their “white and black” multiracial populations in the first decade of the 2000s, it is these Southern states that lead all others. In this time period, the South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama, in that order, more than tripled their white-black multiracial populations, while Tennessee, Florida, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Kentucky are not far behind.

Southern states, as a whole, accounted for 41 percent of the nation’s decade-long gain in the “white and black” multiracial population. Three factors account for the gain: children born to multiracial parents, migration from other regions, and an increase in the willingness to identify with a multiracial heritage in a region where it was long discouraged. The fact that the white-black divide is becoming blurred in the South provides even more evidence that the sharp color lines long evident in the region are beginning to break down.","August 12, 2015",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
30,Duterte’s South China Sea dilemma,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/dutertes-south-china-sea-dilemma/,Richard Javad Heydarian,"“The islands and reefs in the South China Sea are Chinese territory since ancient times,” Chinese President Xi Jinping declared in an exclusive interview during his visit to London last year. Evoking a sense of historical duty, the Chinese leader explained how the contested land features are “left to [modern China] by our ancestors,” vowing that the “Chinese people will not allow anyone to infringe on China’s sovereignty and related rights and interests in the South China Sea.”

It was a defiant justification of China’s massive reclamation activities and increasingly frequent deployment of naval vessels, para-military forces, and militia-cum-fishermen contingents across what it calls its national “blue soil”. In a span of two years, China has built a sprawling network of dual-purpose (civilian and military) facilities on artificial islands, which have been hosting a growing number of uniformed personnel and advanced military hardware like mobile artilleries, high-frequency radars, jet fighters, and surface-to-air-missile systems.

Though China isn’t the first country to have engaged in reclamation activities in the area, no one matches the speed, scale and technological sophistication of its emerging “Great Wall of Sand” in the South China Sea. There is a profound fear across the region that Beijing will soon establish a de facto ‘exclusion zone’ in the area – restricting freedom of navigation and over-flight of regional states and foreign powers, particularly their armed forces.

One neighboring country, in particular, has decided to take China to international court. In late 2012, shortly after China forcibly wrested control of the Philippine-claimed Scarborough Shoal, which falls well within Manila’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) but is located 900 kilometers from the nearest Chinese coastline, Philippine President Benigno Aquino decided to take the case to an arbitration body.

Bereft of the necessary muscle to defend its claim, and absent any tangible military support from long-time allies like America, the Aquino administration undertook the unprecedented decision to settle the South China Sea disputes under the compulsory arbitration clause (Art. 287, Annex VII) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). In coming days, the arbitral tribunal is expected to release a final verdict, most likely unfavorable to China, but it is ultimately up to the Philippines’ newly-elected President Rodrigo Duterte on how to leverage the ruling. It will be his first and arguably most important foreign policy dilemma.

Since arbitration bodies under UNCLOS have no mandate to adjudicate questions of sovereignty (i.e., territorial claim), the Philippines skillfully repackaged its legal complaint against China as, primarily, a question of maritime entitlement zones (see Art. 121, Part VIII on “regime of islands”).

For the Philippines, it’s important to clarify, for instance, whether the disputed land features in the South China Sea constitute low-tide elevations, which (generally) can’t be claimed as one’s territory, or rocks, which can generate their own territorial sea, or islands, which can generate their own EEZ – an issue that carries immense strategic and territorial implications.

In addition, the Philippines, in its thousands-paged-long memorial, raised concerns with respect to China’s purported harassment of Filipino fishermen and energy exploration operations in its EEZ, China’s reclamation activities on low-tide elevations in the Spratly chain of islands as well as their deleterious ecological impact, particularly for coral reefs and endangered species. Most crucially, the Philippines has also questioned the validity and precise nature of China’s nine-dashed-line claim, which covers much of the South China Sea, and its doctrine of historical rights/waters, which undergirds Beijing’s claim in the area but seemingly contradicts prevailing international law.

China tried to procedurally undermine the Philippines’ arbitration case by raising both jurisdictional and admissibility questions: It cited exemption clauses under the UNCLOS (Art. 298, Section 2, Part XV); questioning the competency of the arbitral tribunal to adjudicate what China characterizes as fundamentally sovereignty-related disputes; and argued that the Philippines violated prior bilateral and multilateral agreements by resorting to compulsory arbitration, a supposedly premature maneuver since both parties are yet to fully exhaust available avenues of conciliation.

China even refused to participate in the arbitration proceedings. But the arbitration body (under Art. 9, Annex VII) proceeded with examining the Philippines’ complaint despite the absence of one party, though, in accordance to Art. 5, Annex VII, it consistently provided, in various stages, Beijing the opportunity to defend its case whether through official (i.e., counter-memorial submission) or indirect channels (e.g., public statements, position papers, etc.)

Last October, the Philippines officially overcame both the jurisdiction and admissibility hurdles when the arbitral body announced that it would push through with examining the merits of almost half of the items in the Manila’s memorial, mostly concerning matters purely of bilateral significance, particularly the nature of disputed features in the Philippines’ EEZ; the ecological impact of China’s reclamation activities in the area; and the alleged harassment of Filipino fishermen by Chinese coast guard forces.

With the respect to the remaining items, particularly the validity of China’s nine-dashed-line claims and its ‘historical rights/waters’ doctrine, the arbitral body will examine the question of jurisdiction and their individual merit simultaneously.

The verdict is expected to come out on July 12. Most experts agree that the outcome will be largely unfavorable to China, which has desperately sought to undermine the legitimacy of the arbitral body, claimed to have rallied up to 40 (poor and dependent) countries to question the Philippines’ legal maneuver, and has sought to reach out to the incoming Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte, who has expressed his openness to engagement and finding a modus vivendi with China in the South China Sea.

Of course, it remains to be seen whether the Duterte administration will fully leverage the arbitration verdict or, alternatively, decide to set it aside in order to revive frayed ties with China.

A largely favorable outcome would give the Duterte administration great leverage to extract Chinese concessions – non-imposition of an ADIZ, mutual disengagement from Scarborough Shoal, non-harassment of Filipino fishermen and troops in contested waters – in the South China Sea in exchange for not releasing a strong statement on the need for ‘compliance’ and shunning using the verdict to diplomatically embarrass China.

Of course, there is also the possibility that the verdict will not be favorable to the Philippines, especially if the court issues an indeterminate, obfuscated verdict and shoots down Manila’s arguments in terms of their merits, particularly the one concerning China’s nine-dashed-line claims and doctrine of historical rights.

It is possible that the court will resort to very vague legal semantics to provide China some room to save face and not antagonize the powerful country, which has threatened to withdraw from UNCLOS altogether if it confronts a prejudicial outcome. In this case, Duterte has minimal leverage on China, but he can still open up communication channels, albeit form a weaker negotiating position, by disowning the whole arbitration proceeding as the folly of his predecessor.

There is a third, middle-way option. Both parties can, upon mutual consent, agree to the creation of a “conciliation commission” (under Article 1, Annex V of UNCLOS), which allows both parties to project their supposed respect for international law, preserve diplomatic channels, and address their overlapping claims with the guidance of a mutually-accepted panel of legal experts, who can only provide legal advice but issue no binding verdict.

Much will also depend on how America and other major naval powers will utilize the arbitration verdict to justify more regular, wide-ranging and multilateral Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea, aimed at reining in Chinese assertiveness in the area.

What is at stake is not only regional security in Asia, which has been heavily undermined by the increased militarization of territorial disputes, but also shared access to global commons in accordance to modern international law. It is a clash between China’s “territorial” and “closed seas” vision of adjacent waters, on one hand, and the international community’s call for “open seas” and rule of law in international waters, on the other.","July 5, 2016",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
31,Preventing racial hate crimes means tackling white supremacist ideology,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/preventing-racial-hate-crimes-means-tackling-white-supremacist-ideology/,Rashawn Ray,"A hate crime occurs nearly every hour in the United States. Saturday afternoon was no different. Payton Gendron, an 18-year-old white man, drove to a grocery store in a predominately Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York. He then filmed himself shooting 13 people (11 Black and two white), killing 10, including a retired police officer and an 86-year-old woman who had recently visited her husband in a nursing home. During his domestic terrorist act, Gendron even to the time to apologize to a white man for pointing the gun at him.

Simply put, the rise of hate groups and the increase in the number of hate crimes in the United States is an epidemic. Over the past 20 years, the number of hate groups in the United States increased by over 100%. Though the number of hate groups dipped during the end of Barack Obama’s first presidential term, they rose sharply in the middle of his second term and continued to rise during Donald Trump’s presidential term. Hate crimes were over 200% higher in places where Trump campaigned in 2016.

When we examine who uses guns to commit mass racial violence in the United States, we find that many of these domestic terrorists look and think like Gendron. From 2012 through 2021, nearly three in four murders classified as domestic terrorism were committed by right-wing extremists (most of whom were white nationalists). In 2020, 55% of perpetrators of hate crimes were white, 21% were Black, and 16% were of unknown racial background. Sixty-two percent of hate crimes were about race/ethnicity, nearly 25% were about sexual orientation/gender identity, and 13% were about religion.

In addition to the types of individuals who commit hate crimes, the locations where they happen are notable. In Gendron’s case, he purposefully chose a grocery store in a Black neighborhood. There is a long history in this country of white mobs terrorizing Black neighborhoods (e.g., Tulsa, Rosewood, Wilmington). In January 2020, members of “The Base,” a neo-Nazi white separatist group aiming to start a race war, were apprehended in Maryland and Georgia thanks to good law enforcement work. It is no accident that members of this organization were apprehended in the two states with the most affluent communities of Black Americans.","May 17, 2022",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
32,Kevin Rudd Steps Out Into the World with Elan,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/kevin-rudd-steps-out-into-the-world-with-elan/,Michael Fullilove,"Living abroad can be a useful exercise for an analyst, not only for the insight it gives you into the world but for the line of sight it provides back to your own country. Viewed from a Washington perch, the foreign policy performance of the Rudd Government in its first six months has been strong.

The Prime Minister has consolidated our security alliance with the United States by putting it on a more businesslike footing, while indicating Australia’s willingness to continue sharing our ally’s burdens.

Kevin Rudd has shown considerable agility in his management of the China relationship, too. During his April visit, he opted to balance his Mandarin speaking, which delighted his hosts, with plain speaking on human rights in Tibet, which no doubt disappointed them.

In each case, Rudd pulled off the neat trick of solidifying a bilateral relationship with a great power while establishing an appropriate level of independence from it.

Relations with Japan could have been finessed better at the start, but the Government has moved quickly to remedy that problem. Last month the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith, hosted a successful visit by his Indian counterpart and that relationship looks set to strengthen, despite disagreement on uranium exports.

The Government has rejected its predecessor’s ideological approach to the United Nations, preferring to work pragmatically within the organisation to advance Australia’s interests. It has walked away from the Howard government’s pointless refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Australia is now engaged, at long last, in serious policy work on climate change.

Canberra has also announced programs of work on Asia-Pacific regional architecture and nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. The latter is particularly well-timed, given an emerging view among security hard-heads in Washington in favour of significant cuts to nuclear arsenals and encouraging statements by both presidential candidates. Rudd has signalled the seriousness with which he takes these two initiatives by the calibre of the individuals he has tapped to lead them.

This record may not be perfect, but for a new government it is impressive. To provide historical context, consider the early foreign policy performance of the Howard government, described by one sympathetic observer as “nervous and uncertain”. In its first year, that government botched the race debate generated by Pauline Hanson, which caused many in our region to question our bona fides. It scrapped a concessional finance scheme for developing countries without proper consultation, undercutting our regional soft power.

The China relationship was damaged by the government’s clumsiness and indiscipline. Mistakes and distractions continued into the second year, with the downgrading of Radio Australia’s coverage of South-East Asia and the accidental disclosure of sensitive assessments of Pacific Island ministers. Indeed, it took the Howard government several years to hit its foreign policy straps.

Critics have belaboured the Government’s initial misstep on Japan, losing a sense of the issue’s true proportions. Some have prejudged Rudd’s initiatives on regional architecture and nuclear weapons because of the manner of their announcement. It is much too early to say how these two exercises will turn out, but we do know that the gears of the international system move when political leaders will a change and skilfully apply pressure to achieve it, not when perfect diplomatic consultations are allowed to unfold (although they surely don’t hurt).

For example, the Howard government’s preferred regional vehicle, the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation grouping, was conceived by the then prime minister, Bob Hawke, in Seoul in 1989 without extensive prior discussions with Asian governments or, for that matter, with the various arms of the Australian government.

Some of the same commentators who judged Rudd’s first big overseas trip to be overly long, for instance, also urged that he make more stops along the way.

In a display of considerable chutzpah, foreign affairs budget cuts have been critiqued by members of the previous government, which presided over the stagnation of that budget relative to defence and intelligence.

Politicians who once accused Labor of having a “fortress Australia” mentality and confining itself too narrowly to regional affairs now accuse Labor of frittering away its efforts on global issues that are remote from the concerns of Australian taxpayers.

Questions have been raised about the cost of campaigning for a UN Security Council seat, although any resources expended in that effort will pale into insignificance next to the cost of our involvement in President George Bush’s foolhardy Iraq war, and do much more to boost our global influence.

A few in the Bush Administration, grown accustomed to the Howard approach, feel discombobulated by Canberra’s new direction, but most in Washington, and certainly those who would staff a Barack Obama administration, are impressed by the Rudd Government’s energetic start.","July 14, 2008",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
33,The George Zimmerman Trial: Virtues of an Acquittal,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-george-zimmerman-trial-virtues-of-an-acquittal/,Richard Lempert,"The bottom line is that a boy, on the cusp of manhood, is dead; his only crime: wearing a hoodie while going out to buy a can of soda. Everything that followed is a footnote. There is nothing to celebrate here. The man who killed him is acquitted, although he behaved badly, ignored what the police told him, and appears to have been motivated by racial stereotypes if not racial hatred. He may also, in fact, have committed murder in the second degree or manslaughter, but he will not serve time if he has. Yet his trial and the verdict are not without their virtues.

Chief among them is that legal justice has been done. It is easy to construct scenarios consistent with a guilty George Zimmerman. We have only Zimmerman’s word that Trayvon Martin turned on him or ambushed him, yet he refused to tell this tale under oath. Zimmerman’s claim that Martin pounded his head violently and repeatedly against the pavement such that he feared for his life seems inconsistent with the few bumps and scrapes on his head and the absence of any trace of his DNA on Martin’s fingernails, hands or body. If Martin was pounding Zimmerman’s head, he wasn’t aggressive enough to prevent Zimmerman from retrieving his gun and precisely, or with great luck, aiming it directly at Martin’s heart. The defense’s strongest evidence, testimony that Martin was on top of Zimmerman as they struggled, tells little of moment, even if it is accurate. Consider. You turn to confront a man who has been following you and is closing in. You see him reaching for a gun. You lunge at him to stop him from getting it, and your weight pushes him to the ground with you on top. Your position on top as you struggle does not mean you are the aggressor.

But this is all speculation. People cannot and should not be convicted on speculation. The evidence proving George Zimmerman guilty of murder or manslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt wasn’t there, and it doesn’t matter that it wasn’t there because George Zimmerman never took the stand or because there were no eye witnesses or for any other reason. George Zimmerman was not proven guilty of either murder or manslaughter, and the jury, after some deliberation, reached the right result. If there is anything to celebrate about the trial, this is it. The system worked.

Some might argue, as Alan Dershowitz has, that the system did not work; that the case should not have been tried in the first place, and that George Zimmerman was punished by the process regardless of the outcome. Zimmerman certainly suffered from the process, as any acquitted criminal defendant does, and Dershowitz has a point, but I disagree. By the standards of cases prosecutors regularly bring, this is far from the worst in terms of evidential strength and the likelihood of conviction (Half the jury voted to convict on the first ballot). The state could not know how Martin’s girlfriend, their lead witness, would appear on the stand, nor the quality of Zimmerman’s defense. Moreover, the prosecution did not anticipate that on the eve of trial their potentially most persuasive evidence, the forensic testimony that it was Martin who was calling for help just before the shot was fired, would be barred by the judge. Although this decision too appears correct, prosecutors have often been allowed to present shaky forensic evidence.

If in retrospect the verdict acquitting Zimmerman was correct, the decision to try Zimmerman also had substantial virtues. The initial outrage when Florida’s stand your ground law was invoked to set Zimmerman free with no trial and minimal investigation was more than justified. Absolving Zimmerman of responsibility at that point would have meant that when a person killed another with ambiguous forensic evidence and no witnesses about, the killer’s story of what happened, coupled with consistent but minor and possibly self-inflicted injuries, would be enough to allow the killer to go free. The trial not only dampened outrage triggered by a half-hearted police investigation and a local prosecutor’s overly quick willingness to absolve Zimmerman, but the weaknesses in the evidence the state mustered have dampened outrage at seeing Zimmerman walk, even among those who still believe him guilty. The case no longer represents a Southern state’s refusal to take the killing of a black youth seriously, which is what it stood for when the news first broke. Even if there are some who do not accept the verdict, trying Zimmerman enhanced legitimacy.

The trial also highlights a fundamental flaw in stand your ground laws. If there was not enough evidence to prove Zimmerman guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, there was also insufficient evidence to prove him innocent. That an unjustified homicide was not proved does not mean the homicide was justified. The case turned, as criminal cases often do, on the allocation of the burden of proof, an allocation that the defense emphasized in its closing argument. On the facts as we know them either Zimmerman or Martin could have been the first aggressor. Hence under Florida’s stand your ground law, it is possible that both Zimmerman and Martin could reasonably claim to have been standing their ground in that each honestly and reasonably felt his space and person was being invaded by the other in a way that constituted an attack.[1] If Zimmerman had a legal right to follow Martin as he walked home, Martin had a legal right to confront Zimmerman and to tell him to go away. If a fight ensued in which each party attacked the other, the law appears to authorize each to use force, including deadly force, to prevent the assault the other. Had Martin managed to seize Zimmerman’s gun in the struggle and shot him, Martin would have been the person seeking exoneration because he had stood his ground. It is hard to come up with any policy justification for a law which not only authorizes either of two fighters to use deadly violence but also encourages it by overturning prior law that imposed a duty to retreat if retreat was possible. To the extent “stand your ground” protects a deserved right of self-defense, the law of self-defense is, as we saw in Zimmerman’s trial, more than adequate.

The trial may also have had important educational and deterrence functions.  Future George Zimmermans will most likely be more prone to listen to 911 operators who suggest they back off from following someone they regard as suspicious and wait for the police to arrive, and gun toters in altercations may be less likely to think stand your ground laws will protect them if they pull out their guns and fire. Trayvon Martin’s death may well mean that others will live, but no one who owes his life to Martin and to the decision to try Zimmerman will ever know.

When it comes to race, however, the trial did little to advance conversation. Both the prosecution and the defense tip-toed around the race issue, and some of their comments seemed to deny its existence. As a defense strategy this is understandable; acknowledging the possibility that Zimmerman was motivated by racial prejudice and racial stereotyping would have made the second degree murder charge more plausible and reduced the likelihood of juror identification with Zimmerman. The prosecution most likely had its own goals.  Chief among them, I expect, was to prevent the stoking of racial tensions and to minimize the likelihood of violent reactions to the verdict. These aims are understandable, but had the prosecution’s evidence been stronger the concern for extra-trial consequences might have cost them the verdict they sought.  As the audience, however, we should not ignore race.  It is unlikely that Martin would have been followed, much less killed, had he been white.  Zimmerman did not use the N word in talking about the boy he was following or unprompted refer to his race, but he made it clear that he profiled Martin as a useless punk.

Some commentators have tried to defuse racial motivation claims by suggesting that it was Martin’s hoodie rather than his race that caught Zimmerman’s attention and led to his rant. If true, an interesting lesson about contemporary racism can be drawn. We should ask why wearing a hoodie aroused Zimmerman’s suspicion. I expect it is because Zimmerman and others associate hoodies with black youth and see them as the outfit of black gang members. In these imaginations it doesn’t matter that enough hooded sweatshirts have been sold to garb every black gang member hundreds of times over. If the apologists for Zimmerman are to be believed, the association of hoodies with race and violence is so strong even a white youth wearing one would be regarded with suspicion.  Often today, racial disadvantage works this way.  People unknowingly react to race in ways that disadvantage blacks. With no awareness of what they are doing, employers don’t call the woman with a “black name” on her resume for a job interview but interview a white with identical credentials, or they don’t hire a black man who was charged with possessing marihuana and acquitted, but they “give a second chance” to a white man who pled guilty to possession. Real estate agents encourage the white sounding voice on the phone to come look at a rental unit even though the apartment doesn’t have everything they seek, but they tell the black voice that their preferences mean the apartment is not suitable. Police in training shoot more quickly when a black figure makes a possibly hostile movement than when a white figure does the same. Only controlled tests or statistics reveal how race affects the behavior of some, but the same measures reveal that others behave consistently and without discrimination regardless of race. This means that outside of controlled tests, like “race audits,” one seldom knows whether race has played a role in a job hunt failure or the unexpected renting of an apartment a black couple was interested in.  When race effects are inconsistent and subtle and when both the discriminator and the victim have difficulty perceiving the role that race is playing in decisions, it is difficult to eradicate the systematic disadvantages that plague racial minorities. Yet unless society changes to eliminate the hidden vestiges of past racism, the price paid will include more dead Trayvon Martins.

George Zimmerman’s legal troubles are not entirely over. Some are pressuring the Justice Department to charge him with hate crime or other civil rights violations. This would be a mistake. Many would see federal charges as excessive and illegitimate, and some would attribute prosecution to the fact that the President and his Attorney General are black. But even if these perceptions would not exist, federal criminal law should not be invoked. There is always cause for unease when following an acquittal different laws are invoked to punish a person for the behavior evaluated in the first trial. If the evidence was insufficient to justify culpability, the government, even another government invoking different laws, should not get another bite at the apple. An exception for crimes of racial violence is justified when an acquittal appears to have been against the weight of the evidence and motivated by the biases of a local court and/or jury. That is not the case here. The Florida trial was fair, and the judge and jury seemed impartial. The evidence needed to convict was simply not there. Unless persuasive new evidence that Zimmerman committed a crime is uncovered (e.g., Zimmerman brags that he got away with murder) the federal government should let the matter drop.  The same is not necessarily true of Martin’s family. They could bring a civil suit, in which the burden of proof would be less than in a criminal case, and Zimmerman would have to testify. A suit by Martin’s parents has more to commend it, both in its prospects for success and for what it could do to flesh out the picture of what happened. But a civil jury too might find for Zimmerman, and if Zimmerman is likely to leave a civil suit with his image somewhat sullied, the same will be true of Trayvon Martin.  His parents would be wise to avoid the pain of a legally sanctioned assault on their dead son’s character. Best to leave what is in the past past and to concentrate on making things better in the future. The place to begin making things better is with the repeal of Florida’s stand your ground law.","July 18, 2013",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
34,A New Kind of Terrorist,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-new-kind-of-terrorist/,"Daniel Benjamin, Steven Simon","As the cries of “Je suis Charlie” subside, two facts about the terrorist attacks in Paris stand out. First, every aspect of the response to the violence at the satirical magazine and the Hyper Cacher market has been outsized and extraordinary: the 3.7 million people who turned out to march against the violence, the unprecedented deployment of 10,000 French troops to secure Jewish institutions and even the 3 million-copy run of the latest edition of Charlie Hebdo. On the other hand, as the details of the attack have emerged, it has become clear that this kind of violence represents the new normal in jihadist terrorism.

Whether we look at the recent incidents in Paris, Ottawa or Sydney, there are clear similarities. Low-tech assaults and hostage-takings, these operations are carried out by local militants with little direct involvement from a major jihadist organization. Despite al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula’s claiming responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo killings, the group’s role appears confined to drawing the bullseye on the magazine in its online publication Inspire, and perhaps giving the Kouachi brothers some training and money several years ago. These incidents have not involved spectacular suicide bombings or complex assaults on massive targets like Heathrow Airport or Wall Street. They have all claimed comparatively low numbers of casualties.

Dealing with the problem of self-starter, low-end terror will challenge Western governments and publics for several reasons: intractable conflicts outside the borders of the affected countries that are motivating extremists, the socio-economic problems that are the backdrop for this militancy, the difficulty of identifying potential attackers and low public tolerance for violence.

The spike in the frequency of attacks has been driven in part by the excitement of radical Islamists in the wake of ISIL’s successes in capturing and holding territory in Iraq and Syria and the group’s effort to create an independent caliphate. After almost a decade and a half of setbacks to al Qaeda, ISIL’s capture of Mosul and control of territory from outside Aleppo to Ramadi has provided extremists with a powerful sense that history is turning their way.

The perpetrators themselves have overwhelmingly not been returned foreign fighters. They have been extremists who want to be part of the action, but at home. The recent shootout in Verviers in Belgium, in which returnees from Syria are said to have been involved, may indicate that the foreign fighter challenge is nearer than many had previously thought. But right now, the greater threat comes from those who seek to piggyback on the ISIL phenomenon but haven’t been recruited by the group.

Even before ISIL captured extremists’ attention, the new trend in terrorism was becoming clear, though attacks were less frequent. Early cases included the 2009 Ft. Hood shooting by Maj. Nidal Hassan, which killed 13, the 2012 shootings of seven in Toulouse and Montauban in France by a radicalized petty criminal and the stabbing of British soldier Lee Rigby in 2013 by a group of extremists. The Tsarnayev brothers who carried out the attack on the Boston Marathon belong in this group as well, since they operated without sustained outside guidance and used the crudest bombs imaginable.

Though no one can be pleased that these attacks have occurred, the fact that deaths per incident have come down so dramatically from the days of the Madrid and London attacks—not to mention 9/11—ought to be recognized as a major success in counterterrorism. That’s not to say that terrorists have given up attempting major attacks—al Qaeda in Yemen remains focused on an undetectable bomb to stash aboard an airliner. The United States cannot let its guard down.

The task that intelligence and law enforcement faces in finding these individuals is difficult, especially because the lack of organizational affiliation means they leave fewer traces. So what is to be done? Even the best policy prescriptions bring real challenges.

Task number one is to take ISIL down a few pegs to persuade extremists that their global moment has not arrived. President Barack Obama has been right to avoid the trap of deeper intervention, which would lead to more radicalization. So airstrikes, coalition operations and training for Iraqi forces must be continued and stepped up. All this will take time and more energy than is currently being devoted to the task. The current pace at which the Iraqis, Peshmerga and moderate opposition are developing will not produce the kind of counterbalancing force that can deliver a punishing blow to the jihadists.

Europeans must spend considerably more money and effort on the threat posed by disaffected Muslims in their countries. Though they have stepped up their activity since the Madrid and London attacks in the last decade, the allocation of resources to intelligence collection and law enforcement is still well short of where it should be, as the litany of errors in surveillance of the Kouachis demonstrates.

In a time of austerity, this won’t be easy. But as the Europeans build their capabilities and bring more to the trans-Atlantic intelligence exchange, they will establish relationships with the American intelligence collectors—the NSA above all—who have mostly come in for disparagement in the era of Edward Snowden. That increase in law enforcement and intelligence work will need to be done carefully to avoid provoking greater resentment and radicalization—always a tough needle to thread. The long, slow work of engagement by police and civil authorities to build partnerships with communities and identify extremists early will be essential.

Europeans, as has been widely observed, will also need to do better at integrating their Muslim populations and, more broadly, beat back rising Islamophobia. True, there have been gains, as the Arabic name of one of the slain police officers shows. And the remarkable acknowledgment this week by French Prime Minister Manuel Valls that “geographic, social, ethnic apartheid” exists in France also gives a glimmer of hope. But it comes against an historic backdrop of halting, insufficient action owing to ingrained prejudice, the strong anti-immigration dynamic that is shaping politics from Britain’s UK Independence Party to France’s National Front and Germany’s Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West (PEGIDA).

Europeans have long argued that American-style efforts to promote diversity in the workplace are contrary to their laws, but that argument suggests a lack of imagination. Job-creation spending to pierce the stagnant gloom of Paris’ banlieues is essential. Moreover, the notion that a real campaign against anti-Muslim sentiment is in the works is belied by strong and unreflective support for Charlie Hebdo and its offensive cartoons.

The United States has many advantages over Europe when it comes to protecting itself against homegrown extremism, including a much wealthier, better-educated, widely distributed set of Muslim communities. But the threat of the determined self-starter, like Christopher Lee Cornell, the Ohio-based ISIL sympathizer who was planning to attack the U.S. Capitol until he was arrested last week, will be with us for some time too.

What Europe and the Unites States—where the Paris killings have dominated the news and exacerbated the feeling of an imminent major terrorist threat, rapidly—need above all is a change in attitude, a greater resilience, in the face of this threat. None of our societies has fully absorbed the notion that this kind of terrorist violence is an endemic characteristic of our times.

The high-end threat along the lines of 9/11 has been much diminished by U.S. counterterrorism efforts. But there is no foolproof defense against the Ft. Hood shooters, Boston Marathon-type amateurs and Kouachis. They are as much a part of life today as the killers of Newtown and Columbine. We need to stop them as best we can, but we can neither let them dominate our lives nor make us believe that they threaten our societies. That message, more than any other, is the one that world leaders need to impress upon to the sea of marchers in Paris and the hundreds of millions more around the West around who watched them.","January 22, 2015",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
35,Banning critical race theory could hinder the pursuit of environmental justice,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/banning-critical-race-theory-could-hinder-the-pursuit-of-environmental-justice/,"Keon L. Gilbert, Calvin Bell","Environmental justice (EJ) in the U.S. has become a sociopolitical challenge to pursue a movement that counters environmental injustices that threaten the viability of many communities. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines environmental justice as “the just treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of income, race, color, national origin, Tribal affiliation, or disability, in agency decision-making and other Federal activities that affect human health and the environment.” We can categorize environmental injustices based on their physical impact and social or community impact. Physically, when populations are targeted by developments such as highways, schools, businesses, and housing developments, they are relocated or displaced. These social or community changes lead to a loss of social cohesion, social capital, and can lead to social isolation. Their combined effects can relocate social challenges such as poverty, job access, health care access, and school overcrowding to other geographic communities. Some of the other challenges can come in the form of pollution which exposes communities to new public health risks, therefore contributing to broader and localized climate change.

There are many tools that can be applied to explain the impact of environmental injustice on various segments of the population. One approach is to use critical race theory (CRT) which offers a powerful lens to understand how policies and laws are applied unequally, dislocating and disrupting communities of color. By examining how race and power structures influence where polluting facilities are located and environmental policies are crafted, CRT sheds light on the roots of environmental injustice and paves the way for solutions that promote a cleaner, more equitable future for all. The integration of CRT in environmental policymaking not only exposes these injustices but also guides the development of solutions that foster a sustainable and just society. Specifically, we propose that policymakers prioritize the voices and needs of marginalized communities through CRT-informed legislation, which could include stricter zoning regulations, enhanced environmental protections, and increased investment in community-led environmental justice initiatives. By doing so, we can work toward dismantling the structures that perpetuate environmental racism and ensure that all communities have equitable access to a healthy environment.

Following the 19th century, a modern environmental movement emerged, taking different social routes and policy objectives than the conservation movement prior. The conservation movement focused on preserving the planet, but a crucial aspect began to gain traction following a momentous spark during the Warren County polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) protest: environmental justice.

Environmental injustices are produced by policies and regulations that lead to neighborhoods and communities being polluted, seized, and displaced. There are many historical factors that embody early American policies and American racism that have supported colonization. American colonization paved the way for the exploitation of Indigenous American lands and the forced relocation westward of the groups that inhabited them. Additionally, colonization laid the groundwork for an agrarian economy fueled by enslaving Africans. Dr. Robert Bullard, a scholar and leader in the EJ movement, categorizes this history as environmental racism or “any policy, practice or directive that differentially or disadvantages (whether intended or unintended) individuals, groups or communities based on race or color.”

An environmental racism framework recognizes that people of color and low-income communities disproportionately bear the brunt of pollution and environmental degradation. Environmental justice seeks to address these inequities by advocating for policies and practices that ensure all communities have equal protection from environmental hazards and equitable access to resources and decision-making processes.

Despite legislative advancements in Congress, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Clean Air Act of 1970, environmental injustices persist in insidious forms, underscoring the enduring legacy of racialized marginalization. The construction of toxic waste facilities in predominantly Black and brown neighborhoods—commonly referred to as “environmental racism” —exemplifies how structural inequalities intersect with environmental decision-making processes. Moreover, the unequal distribution of resources for climate adaptation and disaster relief exacerbates vulnerabilities in marginalized communities, amplifying the disproportionate impacts of environmental hazards.

CRT is an academic framework, typically taught in law schools, that examines the intersection of race and racism within politics, culture, and law. Emerging in the late 1970s and early 1980s, CRT posits that racism is not merely the product of individual bias or prejudice but is embedded in legal systems and structures, as described in the scholarship of American legal scholars. CRT helps to explain why policies and legal strategies have been used to expose communities of color to polluted landscapes and why predominantly white, affluent neighborhoods benefit from environmental protections and amenities. Communities of color and lower-income communities often find themselves without the same levels of political capital compared to white and affluent communities, contributing to the concentration of many sources of pollution (e.g., manufacturing waste, hog farms, municipal landfills, etc.).

Recognizing the role of legal strategies and policies is critical to understanding how environmental racism operates. For example, zoning regulations and redlining practices systemically confined Black and Latino communities to areas with high levels of pollution, perpetuating cycles of environmental harm and socioeconomic disenfranchisement. The Biden White House reported that “many lower-income, predominantly minority neighborhoods in cities have become ‘heat islands,’” causing them to experience “higher temperatures than other neighborhoods in the same metropolitan area.” Due to a lack of trees and more concrete infrastructure, communities of color experience heat waves at a higher rate than surrounding suburban communities. These conditions could affect increases in “energy costs (e.g., for air conditioning), air pollution levels, and heat-related illness and mortality.”

In states like Florida, CRT has sparked intense debate among those who do not see the framework in the same light as its forebearers. Conservative critics argue that CRT promotes a divisive view of American history and teaches students to focus primarily on race, suggesting that the United States is fundamentally racist. Some also argue that CRT indoctrinates and politicizes K-12 education despite its primary presence in law schools. In response, several conservative states have introduced or passed legislation to restrict or ban the teaching of CRT in public schools, such as Florida’s “STOP W.O.K.E Act.” In his reelection campaign, Trump has promised to cut federal funding from schools promoting: “critical race theory,” “transgender insanity,” or “any other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.” The message is noticeably clear: Emerging and developing social identities do not matter and are not the business of schools. The result of these threats is the removal of educators, counselors, and other school staff that are responsible for the education of young people, many of whom are experiencing a range of social, emotional, physical, economic, and family challenges that are being framed under CRT and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).

CRT supporters argue that excluding discussions of race from curricula perpetuates historical injustices and hinders understanding of environmental and social inequities. As students grow up in this world, environmental educators believe that CRT provides essential insights into understanding and addressing environmental injustice, which often stems from systemic racism and discriminatory policies. In a time when climate change poses significant health risks and exacerbates existing inequalities, teaching CRT can empower young scholars to critically analyze and tackle these pressing issues, promoting initiatives advocating for a more just and equitable society. A broader understanding of climate, environment, and land use issues may also inspire and encourage young people into the STEAM fields and begin offering innovative solutions to these global challenges. Climate change can become an important concern for youth as they come of voting age. Their understanding of broader environmental concerns such as conservation and how policies shape land use, urban development, and urban sprawl may influence their vote.

Under the Obama and Biden administrations, climate change policies have seen significant advancements, focusing on reducing emissions, promoting clean energy, and addressing environmental justice. The Obama administration’s Climate Action Plan included the Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon emissions from power plants by 32% from 2005 to 2030, promoted renewable energy development, implemented higher fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, and played a key role in the adoption of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Efforts to address environmental justice included the EJ 2020 Action Agenda and strengthening the Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice to integrate these concerns across federal agencies. The Biden administration has continued and expanded these efforts with initiatives such as the American Jobs Plan, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which include substantial investments in clean energy and climate resilience. Biden also made a concerted effort to rejoin the Paris Agreement and launched the Justice40 Initiative, aiming to deliver 40% of federal investment benefits to disadvantaged communities. The establishment of the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council and a focus on supporting communities most affected by climate change further emphasize Biden’s commitment to environmental justice. Both administrations have worked to address environmental racism and promote environmental justice, with the Biden administration taking a more robust approach to ensure that the benefits of climate action reach historically marginalized communities. This includes actively pursuing measures that counteract the rollback of environmental protections instituted during the Trump administration—an agenda that could be threatened if those policies were reinstated in the event of a Trump reelection in November.

Nevertheless, despite legislative advances in pursuit of environmental justice, it is most crucial to amplify and integrate the voices of community members impacted by these issues.

As the 2024 election approaches, climate change remains a significant issue for younger voters. Recent polling shows that about 60% of young adult voters between the ages 18 and 29 believe that climate change should be a priority, while 64% say climate change is a major threat and 72% articulated that climate change was affecting their community. Despite their frustrations with what they perceive as insufficient progress from the Biden administration, many young Democrats still planned to support Biden before he passed the torch to Harris, citing Biden’s broader policy agenda and opposition to GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. Climate change, though not always the top voting issue, has gained prominence over the past decade. Organizations like the Environmental Voter Project emphasize the increasing influence of climate-conscious voters, who have shown their electoral power in past races. As young voters’ “climate anxiety” continues to grow, candidates who fail to prioritize climate action risk alienating this crucial demographic. Not listening to any community and their concerns is anti-CRT. Any limitations that conservatives want to impose on gaining new information or perspectives on the diversity of the U.S. population through anti-CRT and anti-DEI movements (e.g., book bans, funding cuts) are anti-emancipatory (a core principle of CRT is liberation and emancipation to achieve racial equity).

Solutions should be grounded in CRT, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging and addressing systemic inequities facing marginalized communities, particularly those of color. CRT promotes authentic engagement with these communities as part of a cornerstone of any policy, ensuring they are not only heard but are central to the decision-making process. This involves creating intentional platforms for local leaders and activists to shape policy and program priorities through a CRT lens. Looking to coalitions at the national, state, and local levels can provide some guidance for organizations wanting to develop environmental policies and environmental antiracism initiatives. Additionally, policies should be designed with a deeper understanding of the historical and ongoing systemic injustices that shape local contexts and needs.

One of the first steps is to establish community-driven assessment and participatory planning processes that foreground the lived experiences of residents. For instance, implementing community-led monitoring and reporting systems can provide valuable grassroots insights into the effectiveness of climate policies and reveal what needs to be regulated by the EPA and state governmental agencies. Investing in capacity-building within impacted communities—such as funding local environmental justice organizations and supporting education initiatives grounded in the principles of CRT—can empower constituents to advocate for their needs and contribute to sustainable and equitable solutions. Moreover, ensuring transparency and accountability in the allocation of resources, especially those directed towards historically disadvantaged communities, is essential for building trust and ensuring that interventions yield tangible, justice-oriented benefits. By centering the experiences and knowledge of impacted communities, climate policies can become equitable, effective, and responsive to the realities faced by those most vulnerable to environmental injustice. Let us not forget the Flint Water Crisis, Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley,” or arsenic contamination in San Joaquin Valley, but instead, take measures to ensure that history does not repeat itself.","August 19, 2024",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
36,"Biden State of the Union 2023: Biden has good news, but Americans are in a bad mood",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/biden-state-of-the-union-2023-biden-has-good-news-but-americans-are-in-a-bad-mood/,Elaine Kamarck,"Like presidents before him, Joe Biden will almost certainly focus his State of the Union on his accomplishments and on good news. The lowest unemployment rate in 52 years? That will certainly make the list. Inflation coming down? You bet. The public health emergency ending in May? Finally. Manufacturing returning to the United States. Passage of the CHIPS bill so that the U.S. will not be vulnerable to shortages of computer chips, or vulnerable to supply disruptions in the future. The Infrastructure Investment Act which will make the airports sleeker and the roads safer. The Inflation Reduction Act providing money to finally tackle climate change.

And yet Americans are in a really sour mood. An NBC poll asked voters whether America was on a right track or on a wrong track and found that in eight out of nine recent polls over 70% of voters declared America on the wrong track. The most recent poll found that 71% of Americans believe the nation is on the wrong track. “The NBC News’ poll has never before recorded this level of sustained pessimism in the 30-year-plus history of the poll.” This pessimistic mood is found in other polls as well. For instance, Pew found that 78% of Americans were dissatisfied with the direction of the country.

Why? There are, of course, many possible reasons. As Bill Galston and I have written before in these pages, inflation is a particularly tough political problem. Voters are reminded of it every day and the cure (recession) is usually worse than the disease. Decades of low trust in government makes citizens reluctant to believe that government spending can fix many problems. Though fading, the pandemic has left a trail of disruption in its wake. The spike in violent crime has left many citizens feeling unsafe in their own neighborhoods.

America is changing and change makes people uncomfortable. Many Americans complain that they no longer recognize their country. Not all of them are white nationalists or racists; many are just uncomfortable with the changes they have seen in their lifetimes. America is no longer an overwhelmingly white, Christian nation.

At the beginning of the 20th century—1910—88.1% of U.S. citizens were white. Over the next seventy years that number dropped slowly to 79.6% (down 8.5%). But in the next forty years, from 1980 to 2020, the proportion of the population that is white dropped much more rapidly, by 20.8 percentage points. By the 2020 election only 58.8% of the population was white.

“Most noteworthy is the increased diversity in the younger portion of the population. In 2019, for the first time, more than half of the nation’s population under age 16 identified as a racial or ethnic minority. Among this group, Latino or Hispanic and Black residents together comprise nearly 40% of the population. Given the greater projected growth of all nonwhite racial minority groups compared to whites—along with their younger age structure—the racial diversity of the nation that was already forecasted to flow upward from the younger to older age groups looks to be accelerating.”

The diversifying of America has important political and market consequences. While many in these minority groups are still mired in age-old cycles of poverty, prejudice, and powerlessness, others are coming of age and assuming leadership positions. We’ve had a Black president and a Black female vice president and a Black female Supreme Court justice. Equally unnerving to many Americans is the appearance of more and more minorities in commercials. Ad-makers are not interested in political correctness. They are interested in building future market share for their product, whether it’s butter or cars.

Older Americans look at younger generations and don’t see themselves. And the younger generations look at many of the people in leadership positions and wonder why these old white guys are still in charge. No wonder that, in a country where things are going pretty well, the population is wallowing in pessimism, with members of each party convinced that the other is out to destroy the America they know. Non-white Americans are generally more optimistic and see the country on a better track than white Americans, yet both groups share a general pessimism towards the future.

There is no policy fix to this problem; it is fundamentally a problem of generations and of cultures. Politicians can try to soften the rough edges, as Biden will try to do, or exacerbate the fear of change, as Trump has done and continues to do. But until this cycle of change is complete two visions of America will coexist locked in pessimism.","February 3, 2023",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
37,Why ‘busing’ was a fake issue,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-busing-was-a-fake-issue/,Matthew Delmont,"In his first major speech as U.S. Secretary of Education, John King encouraged school districts to take steps towards class-based integration.  “Research shows that one of the best things we can do for all children—black or white, rich or poor—is give them a chance to attend strong, socioeconomically diverse schools,” King said in January. “We should support innovative, voluntary locally-driven efforts to promote socioeconomic diversity in schools.”  King has discussed school integration repeatedly this year and the issue is being debated in policy circles and publicly in a way not seen in nearly 40 years.

These socioeconomic integration plans are compelling because they are pragmatic and offer an end-run around the Supreme Court’s ruling against racial integration plans in Parents Involved in Community Schools (2007).  While class-based school integration efforts are promising, much of the optimism for these plans is based on a sketchy understanding of the resistance to racial and socioeconomic integration since the Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education (1954) decision.  In order to think about how school integration can work in 2016 and beyond, it is important to understand the history of resistance to school desegregation.

In the final pre-publication stages for my recent book Why Busing Failed: Race, Media, and the National Resistance to School Desegregation, the copyeditor e-mailed to ask me, “Do you really want to refer to ‘busing’ in quotation marks throughout the book?” I opted to keep “busing” in scare quotes to emphasize that this term developed in the years after Brown as a selective way to label and oppose school desegregation.

The “busing” of students to racially integrate schools following Brown was about the constitutional rights of black students, but the story of “busing” has been told and retold as a story about the feelings and opinions of white people.  Framing the history of school desegregation in this way has made it possible for parents, school officials, and politicians to describe “busing” for school desegregation as unrealistic, unnecessary, and unfair.

As civil rights advocates continually pointed out, “busing” was a fake issue. Students in the United States had long ridden buses to school, and the number of students transported to school at public expense in the United States expanded from 600,000 in 1920 to 20,000,000 in 1970. In concert with rural to urban migration, school buses made it possible for multi-grade elementary schools to replace one-room schoolhouses and for comprehensive high schools to become commonplace.

School buses, in this era, were among the educational privileges enjoyed by white students. “The white rode buses, the Negro walked long weary miles in all kind of weather, cold, wind and rain, as well as the scortching [sic] heat of summer,” Rosa Parks remembered of her childhood in Montgomery, Alabama. In other parts of the South, as well as New York, Boston, and many other northern cities, students rode buses past closer neighborhood schools to more distant schools to maintain segregation. Linda Brown, the plaintiff in Brown v. Board, rode a bus over twenty blocks to attend a black school, when the white school was only four blocks from her family’s home.  In Boston, more than 50 percent of middle-school students and 85 percent of high school students were bused before the court order for “busing” with no objection, until and unless it was linked to desegregation.  Put more starkly, then, school buses were fine for the majority of white families; “busing” was not.

White parents and politicians framed their resistance to school desegregation in terms of “busing” and “neighborhood schools.” This rhetorical shift allowed them to support white schools and neighborhoods without using explicitly racist language. As early as 1957, white parents in New York rallied against “busing.” In Detroit in 1960, thousands of white parents organized a school boycott to protest the “busing” of three hundred black students from an overcrowded school to a school in a white neighborhood. In Boston, Louise Day Hicks made opposition to “busing” a centerpiece of her political campaigns. “It was Mrs. Hicks who kept talking against busing children when the NAACP hadn’t even proposed busing,” the Boston Globe noted in 1965. “I have probably talked before 500 or 600 groups over the last years about busing,” Los Angeles assemblyman Floyd Wakefield said in 1970. “Almost every time someone has gotten up and called me a ‘racist’ or a ‘bigot.’ But now, all of the sudden, I am no longer a bigot. Now I am called ‘the leader of the antibusing’ effort.” With “busing,” northerners found a palatable way to oppose desegregation without appealing to the explicitly racist sentiments they preferred to associate with southerners.

Describing opposition to “busing” as something other than resistance to school desegregation was a choice that obscured the histories of racial discrimination and legal contexts for desegregation orders. In covering school desegregation in Boston and other northern cities, contemporary news media took up the “busing” frame, and most histories of the era have followed suit. Our understanding of school desegregation in the North is skewed as a result, emphasizing innocent “de facto” segregation while downplaying the housing covenants, federal mortgage redlining, public housing segregation, white homeowners’ associations, and discriminatory real estate practices that produced and maintained segregated neighborhoods.  As policy analysts and scholars like Richard Rothstein, Beryl Satter, and David Freund have shown, “de facto” segregation is a myth.  Furthermore, this history neglects the policies regarding school siting, districting, and student transfers that produced and maintained segregated schools.

My goal in writing Why Busing Failed is to change how we talk about and teach the history of “busing” for school desegregation. Rather than starting the story in the 1970s, we need to understand that the battles over “busing” started two decades earlier in the wake of the Brown decision and in the context of civil rights activism in the North. Rather than focusing exclusively on Boston or seeing South Boston’s Irish residents as uniquely prejudiced, we need to understand how white parents and politicians in cities across the country rallied to defend racially segregated schools. And rather than using “busing” as a politically neutral word, we need to understand that this term developed as a selective way to label and oppose school desegregation.

The long history of “busing” for school desegregation is more nuanced, complicated, and important than any one city’s “busing crisis.” My hope is that by seeing the history of “busing” clearly and speaking honestly about the history of civil rights, people who care about educational equality can chart a more just future.","July 13, 2016",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
38,Why Israelis don’t care whether the U.S. moves its embassy to Jerusalem,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-israelis-dont-care-whether-the-u-s-moves-its-embassy-to-jerusalem/,Shalom Lipner,"Presidents are used to receiving unsolicited advice. Here’s something for President Donald Trump to ponder as he packs his bags for Israel: Many Israelis really don’t care whether the United States moves its embassy to Jerusalem.

Latest reports now suggest that Trump has decided to forestall such a move for the foreseeable future. His path to this destination, after indications that he would eschew the example of all his predecessors, has been tortuous.

Celebrating Israel’s 69th independence day at the White House, Vice President Mike Pence recently reprised administration rhetoric on the matter. “The president of the United States, as we speak,” he told applauding partygoers in the Indian Treaty Room, “is giving serious consideration into moving the American Embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson struck a more tentative figure over the weekend, possibly foreshadowing Trump’s plans to indeed exercise his presidential waiver and leave the embassy where it stands. When Tillerson tried passing the buck, suggesting that Israel might view the move as “perhaps a distraction” to a peace initiative, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired back that “the contrary” was in fact true. Adding to the confusion, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the Christian Broadcasting Network on Tuesday, “Obviously, I believe that the capital should be Jerusalem and the embassy should be moved to Jerusalem because if you look at all their government is in Jerusalem. So much of what goes on is in Jerusalem and I think we have to see that for what it is.”

To be sure, a rare consensus of Israeli Jews endorses Jerusalem as their nation’s capital. They feel strongly that all friends of Israel—first and foremost among them, the United States—should also confer this status on the original City upon a Hill. In their eyes, documents like last month’s UNESCO resolution, which branded Israel as an “occupying Power” in Jerusalem, are not only prejudicial and offensive, but they fly in the face of Israel’s bona fide legal and historical rights in the holy city.

If you engage Israelis in conversation, however, many of them express ambivalence about the embassy question. While they believe unabashedly that all foreign missions should be situated in Jerusalem, they largely reject any portrayal of this project as some form of “concession” to Israel. Few would be willing to proffer any substantial quid in return for what is regarded as little more than a symbolic quo.

From an Israeli perspective, moving the U.S. Embassy would simply correct an injustice and affirm existing reality. Beyond that, it would be of scant practical importance. Today’s Jerusalem is a cosmopolitan venue, a tourist mecca bustling with cultural activity. Home to Israel’s “White House,” its Supreme Court, its Parliament and almost all institutions of its government, Jerusalem hosts world leaders on a daily basis. They stay in its grand hotels and dine at its critically acclaimed restaurants. Leaving aside the mundane concerns of its residents, Jerusalem, by all accounts, is managing pretty well. If anything, it is members of the diplomatic corps who would be the primary beneficiaries of the embassy’s relocation, spared the need to travel back and forth from Tel Aviv to conduct their official business.

Nothing prevents the United States from promoting its swanky consulate in Arnona—a neighborhood in uncontested, western Jerusalem—to embassy class. Even the Russians, who “view West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,” would be hard-pressed to object. Congress already laid the groundwork for the upgrade over two decades ago, when it passed the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act. (Ironically, the other U.S. compound in Jerusalem, on Agron Road, already functions as a de facto embassy to the Palestinians.) And politics notwithstanding, everybody acknowledges that Jerusalem is the seat of Israeli power.","May 19, 2017",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
39,Is Trump ruining the U.S.-Israeli relationship?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/is-trump-ruining-the-u-s-israeli-relationship/,Shalom Lipner,"Nothing is more irksome to Israel’s right-wing establishment than the familiar charge that “the situation”—that is, with the Palestinians—“is unsustainable.” Leveled by critics of supposed Israeli foot-dragging, unsustainability has typically meant that anything less than the all-out aggressive pursuit of peace will ultimately jeopardize the survival of the Jewish state. The merits of such a conclusion are arguable. Either way, sustainability has now resurfaced in the political discourse, pertaining this time to no less a core component of Israel’s national security than its famed partnership with the United States. Can it endure?

Tensions plagued the U.S.-Israeli relationship under the joint stewardship of U.S. President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. At times, it seemed doubtful that the bilateral friendship would withstand their overlapping tenures. Clashes over Iranian nuclear designs, the Middle East peace process, and the best response to Syria’s civil war generated bitter debate—often tinged with personal insults—that drove a wedge between the two countries. As Obama’s tenure approached its end, Netanyahu and then-presidential hopeful Donald Trump signaled to concerned parties that the post-Obama era would witness an instant dissipation of any animosity. Israel and the United States would live happily ever after.

But more than eight months into the Trump presidency, the embers are still smoldering. Netanyahu and his acolytes fed the narrative that Obama’s professed sympathy for Israel was disingenuous, that no friend of Israel in the White House would ever endorse the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran or decline to veto a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israeli policy—both of which Obama did. (Never mind the $38 billion package of security assistance that the Obama administration bestowed upon Israel.) The solid foundations of the mutually beneficial alliance buckled, but proved resilient. Now, Trump is pushing the relationship back toward the breaking point.

Many Israelis—hailing from one of only two countries in the world to express greater faith in Trump’s management of world affairs than Obama’s (the other being Russia)—had high expectations for a renaissance in relations with the United States. Taking Trump at his word that he was Israel’s “biggest friend,” they recorded his promises to immediately relocate the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and watched him mobilize, as president-elect, to block an Egyptian challenge to Israel at the United Nations. Trump’s Jewish supporters in the United States were similarly motivated by the belief that the real estate tycoon (and grandfather to three young Jewish children) would be “good for Israel.” But there seems to be an inverse relationship between Trump’s rhetoric and tangible progress, at least with regard to Israel. His much-touted May visit to Israel was long on symbolism, but remarkably short on substance.

By Israeli standards, No Drama Obama has been replaced by All Stump Trump. His campaign-style pronouncements have been plentiful, but underwhelming. He may mean what he says, but, whether due to inexperience, insufficient bandwidth, lack of talent, actual premeditation, or some combination of all the above, the president has yet to deliver on much of his stated pro-Israel agenda.

Despite repeated assurances that the embassy move is inevitable, Trump’s ambassador to Israel remains based in Tel Aviv. The president’s distaste for the Iran deal has not stopped him from twice certifying Iran’s compliance with its stipulations. Former White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon told 60 Minutes in September that Trump wants to exit the agreement, but meanwhile, it has been Bannon and fellow deal detractors who have exited the administration, including Michael Flynn, briefly Trump’s national security adviser; Sebastian Gorka, now a former deputy assistant to the president; Ezra Cohen-Watnick, former senior director for intelligence programs in Trump’s National Security Council; and Derek Harvey, a former National Security Council member.

Netanyahu must now plead his case before certification advocates such as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. Additionally, the Israeli government’s disdain for UNRWA, the United Nations agency aiding displaced Palestinians, did not dissuade the U.S. State Department from soliciting donor states in August to again cover the organization’s deficit.

One might reason that each of these U.S. policies might actually serve Israel’s interests in the long term, but that would be beside the point. Israelis were hankering for an American commander-inchief who would be attentive to their prerogatives, not one who allegedly knows better than them what Israel needs. Some Israelis might still take comfort in the belief that the problem stems from inertia or slow-to-die bureaucratic habits in the United States. But that can’t possibly account for all that has befallen Israel at the hands of the new administration. Some of the innovations have Trump’s own signature on them.

Russia’s triumphant return to the Middle East as the foremost patron of Syrian leader Bashar alAssad, who is also supported by Israeli nemeses Iran and Hezbollah, has thrown Jerusalem and Moscow together. Because of the close proximity of Israeli and Russian forces, the two have had to work together on deconfliction, but by no means are the two entering a new era of blind trust or convergence of purpose. Enter Trump, whose fascination with Russia appears to pose a strategic problem for Israel in its home region.

Last May, while hosting Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergei Kislyak in the Oval Office, Trump reportedly divulged classified Israeli intelligence on Islamic State (ISIS) activities in Syria. Livid Israeli officials were spooked that the president’s showboating before his Russian guests had exposed valuable covert assets and efforts. Far from benign, Trump’s reckless action hurt collaboration between the United States and Israel, cooperation which can continue only in an atmosphere of confidence and discretion.

Shortly afterward, in July, Israel was again horrified when the administration’s negotiations with Russia produced a plan for a ceasefire in Syria that ignored key Israeli concerns. With Iran angling to expand its presence on Israel’s doorstep, officials in Jerusalem presented their reservations about the emerging deal to senior American interlocutors. Topping the list was Israel’s adamant objection to any arrangement permitting Iran, Hezbollah or other hostile militias from maintaining a foothold on Israel’s borders. Discarding his emblematic caution when it comes to criticizing Trump, Netanyahu publicly voiced his adamant opposition to the ceasefire pact to journalists covering his visit to Paris.

The only bright spot in the U.S.-Israeli relationship for Netanyahu and his governing coalition has been the Trump administration’s approach to the Israeli-Palestinian theater. With Netanyahu embroiled in corruption scandals and Trump’s attention divided among myriad hot spots at home and abroad, neither is particularly ready—optimistic soundbites notwithstanding—to take on the challenge of attempting a breakthrough peace agreement. In fact, the president’s agitated claims that he’ll close the “ultimate deal” and (muffled) State Department censure of Israeli settlement activity have been largely offset by the broader canvas of U.S. diplomacy.

Accommodating Netanyahu’s misgivings about a two-state solution to the conflict, Trump has famously proclaimed that he’s “looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like.” In leaked remarks, his senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner discounted demands for Israeli concessions when he suggested that “there may be no solution” to the dispute at all. The administration’s focus on the smaller building blocks of peace, such as the water infrastructure agreement announced in July by presidential envoy Jason Greenblatt, fits the disposition of Israel’s conservative government like a glove.

And yet, even in this area, Israeli planners are at a severe disadvantage owing to a discipline deficit within the administration. When U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman recently said that he believes “the settlements are part of Israel,” U.S. State Department spokeswomen Heather Nauert rushed to brief reporters that that his words “should also not indicate a shift in U.S. policy.” This volatile situation, in which it remains unclear who best represents American foreign policy directives, means that Israel cannot take statements by administration officials at face value.

Complicating matters between Israel and the U.S. has been Trump’s tortuous dance with issues of race. Charged in Deuteronomy to “love the stranger because you were strangers in Egypt,” Jews have stood prominently at the forefront of civil rights battles in the United States, where rabbis marched alongside Martin Luther King Jr. on the road from Selma to Montgomery in 1965. And as standard-bearer of the Jewish people among the family of nations, the Jewish state cannot possibly remain indifferent in the face of resurgent racism—including manifest anti-Semitism—much of it attributed to Trump enthusiasts.

Alarm bells were sounded during the first week of the Trump presidency when the president’s message for International Holocaust Remembrance Day omitted any specific reference to the genocide of six million Jews at the hands of the Nazis. The incident, on the heels of a series of other controversies involving Trump and his devotees, suggested that the White House was deaf (or worse) to Jewish sensibilities. Only after weeks of private petitioning by Jewish leaders did Trump finally declare that “anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible, and are painful, and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.” And then came Charlottesville.

Trump’s waffling response to the August 12 white supremacist march in the Virginia college town left the entirety of the Jewish community seething. His insistence that “there is blame on both sides,” effectively equating the Ku Klax Klan and its fellow travelers with those protesting against them, was a bridge too far for even some of his loyalists. Gary Cohn, who is the chief of the White House Economic Council and Jewish, reportedly drafted (but did not submit) a letter of resignation in protest. The Republican Jewish Coalition joined its “political and religious brethren in calling upon President Trump to provide greater moral clarity.” The rabbinical umbrella of U.S. Orthodox Jewry, which largely went for Trump at the polls, entreated the president to “understand the critical consequences of his words.” In a not-so-subtle rebuke of the president, AIPAC, protector of the U.S.-Israeli relationship, urged “all elected officials to reject moral equivalence between those who promote hate and those who oppose it.” A bipartisan group of 11 former White House liaisons to the Jewish community slammed Trump. “His equivocation and unwillingness to speak clearly, without restraint, against blatant examples of racism, anti-Semitism and related manifestations of hate, as well as his refusal to lay blame for violence, are anathema to the best traditions of his office and to the examples set by the presidents we served,” they wrote.

Israeli officialdom cringed at the images and words generated by the Charlottesville affair. Here too, Trump’s comportment was a liability, forcing the Netanyahu government to tread lightly. Under pressure to join the chorus rejecting any equivalence between neo-Nazis and their ideological adversaries, the prime minister was ever conscious of the overriding obligation to maintain a friendly rapport with Israel’s chief patron. The result was a forced moral lapse: a delayed and inexplicit statement that further alienated portions of the U.S. Jewish community already critical of Israel. In a bizarre twist, alt-right figure Richard Spencer sought to deflect charges of racism by seeking common cause with Israelis, telling Israel’s Channel Two that he was deserving of their respect as a “white Zionist.”

In fact, the advent of Trump has had a broader detrimental impact on Jewish solidarity with Israel. A wide swath of American Jews, a plurality of whom voted for Hillary Clinton, bristles at the imperative of the Israeli government to interact constructively with the administration. According to polling by the American Jewish Committee, almost 80 percent of Jews in the United States have an unfavorable view of Trump’s performance, with majorities voicing negative opinions on every parameter. Different hierarchies of interest have emerged: Jews in the United States are focused primarily on their own safety and the future of their divided country, whereas Israel has essentially subordinated these concerns to the preservation of its cooperative alliance with the Trump administration as a guarantee of its national survival.

This calculus was broadcast clearly by Netanyahu’s communications minister, Ayoub Kara, who told the Jerusalem Post that “we need to put the declarations about the Nazis in the proper proportion… Trump is the unquestioned leader of the free world, and we must not accept anyone harming him.” The director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s Israel branch defended Netanyahu’s initial silence. Jumping in would have demonstrated “bad manners” and been “insulting” to the United States, he said.","October 10, 2017",Brookings Institution,race prejudice

41,Black-white disparity in student loan debt more than triples after graduation,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/black-white-disparity-in-student-loan-debt-more-than-triples-after-graduation/,"Judith Scott-Clayton, Jing Li","The moment they earn their bachelor’s degrees, black college graduates owe $7,400 more on average than their white peers ($23,400 versus $16,000, including non-borrowers in the averages). But over the next few years, the black-white debt gap more than triples to a whopping $25,000. Differences in interest accrual and graduate school borrowing lead to black graduates holding nearly $53,000 in student loan debt four years after graduation—almost twice as much as their white counterparts. While previous work has documented racial disparities in student borrowing, delinquencies, and defaults, in this report we provide new evidence that racial gaps in total debt are far larger than even recent reports have recognized, far larger now than in the past, and correlated with troubling trends in the economy and in the for-profit sector. We conclude with a discussion of policy implications.

Amidst the general public concern over rising levels of student loan debt, racial disparities have attracted increasing attention. In 2006, a U.S. Department of Education report noted that black graduates were more likely to take on student debt, and in 2007, an Education Sector analysis of the same data found that black graduates from the 1992-93 cohort defaulted at a rate five times higher than that of white or Asian students in the 10 years after graduation (Hispanic/Latino graduates showed a similar, but somewhat smaller disparity).[i] Recently, momentum on the topic has been growing, with several new studies documenting how students of color are disproportionately burdened by student debt:

Unfortunately, because the U.S. Department of Education does not regularly track borrowers by race, data limitations have hampered efforts to connect research on racial gaps with detailed new studies of debt and default patterns. For example, highly-cited recent research which analyzed administrative data linking borrowers, future earnings, and defaults cannot be broken out by race.[v] Information on race is not collected on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), nor is it included in the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) which tracks outstanding debt and repayments. Most of what we know about the debt gap is based on cross-sectional surveys conducted by the U.S. Department of Education only once every four years, which don’t allow borrowers to be tracked over time, or on longitudinal surveys which are conducted even less frequently.

In August 2016, the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC)—supported by nearly 40 other public interest groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)—sent a letter to Education Secretary John King demanding the department track and remedy the disproportionate consequences of student loan debt for borrowers of color.[vi] “For nearly a decade,” the letter states, “the Department of Education has known that student debt impacts borrowers of color differently from white borrowers. Yet in that decade, the Department has failed to take sufficient steps to ameliorate the disproportionately negative impact on borrowers of color, or even to conduct further research to discover the causes or the extent of disparities.”

As we will show, this concern is well-justified. Cross-sectional analyses which do not follow borrowers over time, as well as longitudinal analyses that track graduates from distant cohorts and/or rely upon self-reported debt amounts (which are known to be underreported[vii] and generally inaccurate[viii]), can lead to dramatic understatements of racial disparities in student loan debt.

In this report, we present new analyses of restricted-use data from the Department of Education’s Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) 93/97 and 08/12 surveys, which follow graduates from the 1993 and 2008 cohorts through 1997 and 2012, respectively. We supplement with additional Department of Education and Census Bureau data, in order to document the vast racial disparity in student debt, explore possible causes, and discuss policy implications. Importantly, the B&B surveys are linked to administrative NSLDS data on student loan borrowing, repayment, and default rather than relying on self-reports. The B&B:08/12 does not yet follow students as long as its 1993 counterpart (which ultimately followed students for 10 years post-graduation), but already provides sufficient follow-up to reveal distressing racial disparities.

We find that previously-reported differences in debt at graduation—of about $7,400—are less than one-third of the total black-white debt gap four years later, due to differences in both repayments and new graduate borrowing (we focus primarily on the black-white gap, which is by far the most pronounced). Four years after graduation, black graduates have nearly $25,000 more student loan debt than white graduates: $52,726 on average, compared to $28,006 for the typical white graduate.[ix] Despite reductions in default rates between the 1992-93 and 2007-08 cohorts, black college graduates are still substantially more likely to default on their debt within four years of graduation (7.6 percent versus 2.4 percent of white graduates). And nearly half of black graduates (48 percent) owe more on their federal undergraduate loans after four years than they did at graduation, compared to just 17 percent of white graduates (a situation known as negative amortization).

Our analysis reveals the surprising, disproportionate role of graduate school enrollment—particularly for-profit graduate enrollment—in contributing to the overall black-white debt gap, and raises questions about how these racial debt disparities will further evolve beyond the end of the follow-up period. Unfortunately, these questions will remain unanswerable until we have better ways of tracking student debt by race over a longer period of time. Below, we highlight our main findings and conclude with a discussion of policy implications.

Four years after earning a bachelor’s degree, black graduates in the 2008 cohort held $24,720 more student loan debt than white graduates ($52,726 versus $28,006), on average.[x] In the 1993 cohort, the difference was less than $2,000 ($8,723 versus $6,917; amounts adjusted to 2012 dollars). Figure 1, Panel A below shows that Hispanic and Asian graduates have debt burdens much more similar to white students.

What are the consequences of these large disparities in debt? Default rates among borrowers have actually fallen sharply among all races (see Figure 1, Panel B), likely due to changes throughout the 1990s which increased the penalties for institutions with high default rates and made it harder for students to avoid making repayments even after entering default (more recently, new repayment options may also have played a role).[xi] Still, black borrowers remain more than three times as likely to default within four years as white borrowers (7.6 percent versus 2.4 percent). Hispanic borrowers, despite having about the same level of debt as white graduates, are more than twice as likely to default (5.7 percent).

Moreover, just because borrowers have not defaulted within four years does not mean they are out of the woods. The income-contingent repayment, forbearance, and deferment provisions that help protect students against the worst outcome of default may also obscure other signs of borrower distress: for example, nearly half (48 percent) of all black graduates owe more on their federal undergraduate loans at this point than they did at graduation, compared to just 17 percent of white graduates (Figure 1, Panel D).

At graduation, black students owe $7,375 more than their white peers ($23,420 versus $16,046). This difference represents less than a third (30 percent) of the nearly $25,000 black-white gap in total debt that exists four years later.[xii] For blacks, undergraduate debt at graduation accounts for less than half of total debt owed, compared to 62 percent for white graduates.

A full 45 percent of the black-white gap ($11,094) comes from differences in borrowing for graduate school. Black college graduates are almost twice as likely as white graduates to accumulate graduate school debt (40 percent versus 22 percent). These differences in graduate school borrowing are driven by significantly higher rates of graduate enrollment (discussed more below), as well as higher rates of borrowing conditional on enrollment.

Finally, about one-quarter of the gap in total debt ($6,252) comes from differences in rates of repayment and interest accrual. Black graduates are much more likely to experience negative amortization (interest accumulating faster than payments received): nearly half (48 percent) of black graduates see their undergraduate loan balances grow after graduation, compared to just 17 percent of white graduates. On net, black graduates owe 6 percent more than they have borrowed, while white graduates owe 10 percent less than they have borrowed, four years after graduation. Differences in repayment rates may be partly attributable to growing black-white wage gaps, as well as to differences in graduate enrollment (which allows students to defer loan payments).[xiii]

Finding #3: Graduate school enrollment rates increased substantially for blacks between the 1993 and 2008 cohorts, much more so than for other groups, and the differential growth has occurred almost exclusively in the for-profit sector.

Nearly half of black graduates (47 percent) in the 2008 cohort enrolled in a graduate school degree program within four years, compared to 38 percent of white graduates (see Figure 3).[xiv] This is a shift from 15 years prior, when black graduates were only slightly more likely to enroll in graduate school compared to white graduates (38 percent versus 35 percent).[xv] While this may be a positive trend in general, we also find that among graduate school enrollees, more than a quarter (28 percent) of black graduate students enroll in for-profit institutions—compared to just 9 percent among white graduate students.[xvi]

While we cannot separately identify for-profit graduate enrollment for 1993 graduates, cross-sectional enrollment data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey (NPSAS) allow us to examine how graduate enrollment patterns have changed over time. Figure 4 shows that as recently as 2004, for-profit institutions accounted for no more than 7 percent of enrollment among any racial subgroup. But between 2004 and 2008, for-profit graduate enrollment increased dramatically for black students. Indeed, Figure 5 shows that growth in for-profit enrollment (and “multiple institution” enrollment, which may also include some for-profit enrollment) can account for all of the differential growth in black graduate school enrollment between 2004 and 2012: at public and private not-for-profit institutions, black students have remained a roughly constant percentage of the graduate population.

Two factors may contribute to the rapid growth in black graduate enrollment. First, the Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005 (HERA 2005) greatly increased federal borrowing limits for graduate students.[xvii] Beginning in 2006, graduate students could borrow up to the cost of attendance via the Grad PLUS loan program; previously, graduate students were limited to the annual Stafford Loan maximum of $20,500. The expansion of graduate loans may have had a differential effect on black graduates, who have less parental wealth to draw upon. And for-profit institutions—where the typical graduate enrollee racks up $33,000 in debt—may have been quickest to respond to the new market opportunity. It’s important to note that graduate enrollment has also increased at public and private not-for-profits, and that graduate students at private not-for-profits accumulate even higher levels of debt.[xviii] But the for-profit sector is by far the fastest-growing sector and the only sector that has seen enrollments grow differentially by race.[xix]

Second, these increases occur alongside evidence of growing racial gaps in college graduates’ labor market outcomes, suggesting graduate school may for some students be a response to the weak post-recession labor market. Among the 1993 cohort, black graduates were just as likely as white graduates to be employed four years later (90 percent versus 89 percent) and slightly more likely to be employed full-time (87 percent versus 81 percent). But among the 2008 cohort—who graduated just on the cusp of the Great Recession—the employment rate drops sharply to 72 percent for black graduates, while dipping more modestly to 83 percent for white graduates (see Figure 6). This employment gap is consistent with other data[xx] showing that the Great Recession hit black college graduates much harder than white college graduates, as well as with evidence[xxi] that employers are more likely to discriminate against minorities in weak labor markets.

Finding #4: The striking black-white disparities we find are far more pronounced than the gaps by parental income or education, and the black-white gap is the only one that grows substantially after graduation.

Finally, an important finding of our investigation is that the patterns we report above are largely specific to the black-white debt gap: they cannot be explained away by racial differences in parental education or income. It is certainly true that students from poorer or less-educated families accumulate more debt than those from richer or more highly educated families. But Figure 7 shows that the black-white total debt gap is five times bigger than the debt gap by parental education, and almost twice as big as the debt gap between those who received Pell grants as undergraduates and those who did not.

Moreover, for these other groups the debt gap at graduation is indicative of the debt gap that exists four years later—the black-white gap is the only one that more than triples in size. Unlike the patterns we observe by race, college graduates’ employment rates do not vary substantially by parental education or Pell grant eligibility. And unlike black graduates, first-generation college graduates and Pell-recipient graduates are substantially less likely to attend graduate school than their peers.[xxii]

To the extent that black-white debt disparities are driven by higher rates of graduate enrollment, is this a problem to solve or a sign of progress to celebrate? Graduate degrees confer large returns in the labor market: graduate degree-holders in 2012 earned 21 percent more than those with only a bachelor’s degree.[xxiii] Analyzing data on 25-45 year olds in the American Community Survey (ACS), we find that the additional earnings boost from graduate degrees is even larger for black students (though our estimates suggest that blacks with graduate degrees still earn less on average than whites with only a bachelor’s degree).[xxiv] Thus, it is possible that higher rates of borrowing in the short term could lead to improved outcomes further in the future.

This optimistic scenario, however, is far from guaranteed, and a number of patterns in the data give cause for concern. First is the disproportionate concentration of black graduate students in the for-profit sector—a sector which, at the undergraduate level, has been riddled with problems concerning high-debt, low-quality, and sometimes even fraudulent programs.[xxv] Unfortunately, the ACS data do not enable us to separately estimate returns by graduate institution type, and the dramatic increase in for-profit enrollments is too recent to have much influence on aggregated estimates from the ACS (which pool across recent and older cohorts).

Second, graduate degree completion rates appear to be lower, or at least slower, for black graduate students than white graduate students. As Figure 8 shows, black bachelor’s degree holders are about as likely as their white counterparts to have earned a graduate degree four years later (23 percent versus 22 percent) despite their much higher rates of graduate enrollment.

Third, even if graduate degrees remain a good investment on average, black students clearly face substantially greater financial risk in pursuing them given their higher levels of borrowing and lower average earnings. Using the B&B:08/12 data, we examine total debt-to-income ratios for individuals who are employed full-time in 2012 and not currently enrolled, and find that black students with graduate degrees have debt-to-income ratios that are 27 percentage points higher than white graduate degree holders (even after controlling for other characteristics such as parental education and income).[xxvi] While default rates are still much lower for black borrowers with any graduate enrollment versus no graduate enrollment (3.9 percent versus 12.3 percent), 42 percent of black borrowers with graduate enrollment are still deferring their loan payments, making the default rates less informative regarding long-term repayment prospects.[xxvii]

In their August letter to Secretary King on behalf of 40 public interest groups, the NCLC highlights some of the troubling causes and consequences of racial disparities in student debt, including racial targeting by for-profit institutions and abusive debt collection practices.[xxviii] Our new findings suggest their concern is not only justified, but may well be understated. We conclude with the following policy implications:

Implication #1: In order to truly understand the causes and consequences of massive racial disparities in student debt, we need to be able to track debt and repayment patterns by race.

Being able to track a cohort of bachelor’s degree recipients for four years, once every fifteen years, is helpful, but insufficient. While the B&B:08/12 cohort will be surveyed a final time in 2018, given high rates of graduate school enrollment, even a ten-year follow up may not fully capture the long-term consequences of racial debt disparities. We also need to be able to track the debt gap with greater frequency, as contextual factors—including economic conditions, financial aid policies, and the role of for-profits—can change quickly. The most practical way to do this is to collect information on borrower race so that it can be incorporated into administrative databases that track borrower outcomes.

Incorporating race into administrative databases would also fill the gaping data void regarding how racial debt disparities evolve for those that leave college without a bachelor’s degree (there is no equivalent to the B&B survey at other attainment levels). Recent analyses of administrative data suggest that borrowers who leave college without earning a degree are at even greater risk of default than those who graduate, even if they graduate with more debt. And prior reports have already documented large racial disparities in the likelihood of leaving college without a degree.[xxix] In fact, more than one in every four black college entrants (28 percent) leaves college with debt, but no degree—a precarious status that applies to only 15 percent of white college entrants.[xxx]

Finally, data availability is not the only factor explaining the limited research in this area; researchers also need to pay attention to the data that do exist. Where data allow, any analyses of student debt should be attentive to heterogeneity by race. Where data do not allow, analysts should acknowledge that the patterns that hold for the majority may be very different for borrowers of color.

Among college graduates, the black-white gap in undergraduate borrowing is less than a third of the total gap four years later. Our analysis highlights the substantial role of graduate school in expanding the black-white debt gap, and indicates that the enrollment growth for blacks has been highly concentrated in the for-profit sector. We thus need more evidence on the payoffs of specific types of graduate education, particularly in the rapidly-growing for-profit sector. In addition, the financial aid system—which treats all graduate students as independent, and thus does not consider parental income—fails to acknowledge systematic racial and socioeconomic differences in financial support that continue throughout young adulthood.

Our findings also add to prior evidence that differences in labor market outcomes—employment rates and earnings—exacerbate racial debt gaps.[xxxi] If these gaps are evident among college graduates who have generally strong employment prospects, they may be even worse among those who leave college without a bachelor’s degree.

Finally, it is important to recognize that reducing debt by simply discouraging or limiting student borrowing—at either the undergraduate or graduate level—is not a solution, and could well make educational disparities worse.[xxxii] A recent study by Jackson and Reynolds, for example, finds that loans promote higher rates of persistence and completion among black undergraduates, and concludes that despite racial gaps in default rates, loans are nonetheless “an imperfect, but overall positive tool for reducing educational inequality” by race.[xxxiii]

Implication #3: New repayment options such as the Revised Pay-As-You-Earn (REPAYE) plan may alleviate the worst consequences of racial debt disparities, while failing to address underlying causes.

Income-contingent loan repayment options, including the newest and most generous REPAYE plan, adjust borrowers’ monthly payments according to their income and ultimately forgive debts that remain after a set period of repayment. In theory, such plans can help borrowers of any race manage even relatively large amounts of debt. The paperwork burden currently associated with such plans can be daunting, however, and too often students do not learn about income-contingent options until after they are already in trouble—having missed payments, accumulated fees, and damaged their credit. As a solution, some scholars have proposed automatically enrolling borrowers in income-contingent repayment, and administering it via the tax system so that payments adjust immediately and automatically to changes in earnings.[xxxiv]

While income-contingent repayment can help reduce the worst consequences of the racial debt gap, it treats the symptoms without acknowledging or remedying the underlying causes of the disparity. Plans like REPAYE are meant to address the idiosyncratic risks of educational investments—not to address systemic racial inequality resulting from historical discrimination (leading to low parental wealth), ongoing racial bias in the labor market, or predatory recruitment by for-profit institutions. Federal financial aid policy alone cannot solve these problems—but neither can it ignore the challenges facing students of color who disproportionately bear the burden of student debt.

42,Obama’s Egypt Speech: What He Said to the Muslim World,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/obamas-egypt-speech-what-he-said-to-the-muslim-world/,Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World,"On June 4, President Obama delivered what was billed as a “major speech to the Muslim world” in Cairo, Egypt. As a followup to

commentary prior to the speech
, the Saban Center at Brookings’ Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World asked leading experts and policy-makers from the United States and the Muslim world to submit their thoughts on the speech.

President Obama’s speech succeeded on several levels. First, the President addressed all of the key issues that currently shape the relationship between the U.S. and Muslims – Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, and Arab-Israel conflict, democracy promotion, and women’s rights. In laying out these issues, Obama was very clear and direct in calling for to a new beginning in the relationship between Muslims and United States.

Second, Obama tried to satisfy all parts in the Muslim world and Middle East, mentioning Arabs, Muslims, Christians, Jews, Shi’ites, Sunnis, and Copts. Obama made it clear that all these parties should work together to change the stereotypes about each other and forge new avenues for improved relations.

Generally, Obama was honest in addressing differences and commonalities between U.S. and Muslim world, and he called on all Muslims to focus on common ground and to decrease the differences between peoples. I would say that Obama won the first round in the battle of winning Muslim hearts and minds. However, the critical question remains – will these words to be translated into actions and policies by the U.S. administration or not, and what will Muslims and Arabs do to help Obama in this endeavor.

At President Obama’s speech yesterday, an elderly bearded man holding a prayer beads in hand sat next to me at the Cairo University as we waited for the long anticipated speech. I asked him what his expectations were from President Obama. He replied, “We just want to be treated with respect.” As The President used his second quotation from the Koran, the man sitting next to me impetuously stood up and shouted “Obama, I love you!” After the speech, he said “we have been waiting for this for a very long time. I hope he will be able to transform these words into actions.” Likewise, former head of one of the largest business organizations called to offer congratulations on a “great” speech and said he is “now ready to visit the U.S.” after an eight year hiatus. Similar sentiments were echoed by another prominent TV commentator in a call to me. He described the speech as “historic” and added, “This is a very good beginning. Now, we as Arabs have to do our part to take the necessary steps to respond to these positive gestures. We need to translate these words into tangible results.” In an open letter to the Al-Ahram Weekly, Sheikh Ali Gomaa, Grand Mufti of Egypt, wrote that “policies can only be improved by adopting a collection of [positive] actions and attitudes.”

The operative word in reaction to the President’s speech was “action.” In many ways, giving the speech was the easiest part. The toughest part will be translating these words into actions where all parties see and feel the change on the ground. After 60 years, to many in the Arab and the larger Muslim world the core issue remains the Israeli-Palestinian territorial conflict. This territorial conflict between Christian/Muslim Palestinians and the Israelis was exploited by the religious extremists, and was turned into a rallying call for jihad, thus emphasizing the religious dimensions with repercussions from Morocco to Indonesia. The perpetuation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been the salient factor in a propaganda war launched by the extremists against the United States and its allies. The images of Palestinian subjugation and suffering at the hands of Israeli Defense Forces are broadcasted endlessly on Middle Eastern satellite channels, thus giving extremists a recruiting bonanza for future jihadists and suicide bombers. With more than 50% of the region’s population under the age of 25 and increasingly diminishing prospects for education and employment, America’s allies in the region are sitting on a powder keg.

President Obama has rightfully recognized the often ignored fact that the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not only in the national interests of Israel and the Arab countries but is also in the U.S. national interests. It is the resolution of this conflict or lack thereof that would ultimately determine the success or failure of President’s policy of engagement with the Muslim world. As a cab driver said to me, “we all love Obama and we know the task ahead is tough, but the fact remains the U.S. is the only country in the world that has the ability to bring both sides to the negotiating table and deliver results.”

I am certain about two things. I am a Muslim, and I live in this world. Now the uncertainties begin. On 4 June you gave what was heavily advertised as a major speech to the “Muslim world”. Does that mean that while every Christian believes in the divinity of Jesus, he can be legitimately and widely varied in his political interests, but Muslims must have both Allah and politics in common?

As an Indian Muslim I belong to the second largest Muslim community in the world. I also live, proudly, as an equal, in India, a nation that contains the largest Hindu community in the world. Do you think I have the same political views as my fellow Muslims in Pakistan or Bangladesh or Nepal? You did mention that there are around six million Muslims in America. Were you speaking to them, or on their behalf, in Cairo? But for the accidents of life, you could have been an American Muslim, a Kenyan Muslim or an Indonesian Muslim. Would the same speech serve for all three?

Muslims live not only in different cultures and geo-political spaces, but also under different Constitutions. Indonesia, which is the largest Muslim nation, does not believe in a state religion. Pakistan, the second largest, became the world’s first Islamic republic. There are kings and autocrats and elected heads of government in the “Muslim world”, and one category that can only be described as “immoveable object” unopposed by any irresistible force. Many Muslims live on the margins. Not many seem aware of this fact, and it is possible that none of your speechwriters pointed it out, but 10% of the Russian population is Muslim. Islam came to that vast Eurasian region around the same time as the Christian church. Do Russian Muslims belong to the same “Muslim world” as Indonesians and Moroccans? The Chinese keep their Muslim-majority province, Xingiang, a sort of closely guarded state secret, frightened that Islam might jump up and bite off Communism’s ear. Which world do these Muslims belong to? And what about the chaps in Britain, who probably went over on the assumption that Britain was still Great. Or the French Muslims, whose ears are still ringing with the famous Sarkozy diktat: “Off with their headscarfs!” Where would you place them? In Above-Saharan Africa?

At one point you were kind enough to suggest that “America is not – and never will be – at war with Islam”. But no sane person ever accused America of being at war with Islam. America would have to be a theocracy, with Inquisition as its preferred domestic policy, and conversion as the principal instrument of foreign affairs, to declare war on Islam. I hope you will not accuse me of being pedantic, in the sense of calling a toothache a gum-ache. The conflation of Islam and Muslims is precisely the kind of misconception that encourages pre-nation-state fantasies like the revival of a Caliphate. One might add that while every Muslim was deeply committed to his faith, political disputes among Muslims began with the election of the very first Caliph, Hadrat Abu Bakr. Muslims see themselves as a brotherhood, not a nation-hood. If Islam is sufficient glue for nationalism, why would Arabs be living in 22 countries? That should have been obvious while you were snacking on Arab cookies and Islamic lemonade in Cairo.

“Islam and the West” is another phrase wandering through a dialectic shaped within the Queen of Alice’s Wonderland. Islam is a faith; the West is geography. How do you construct a relationship between faith and geography? You can have a debate on Islam and Christianity, or indeed between the West and West Asia, or the West and South Asia, or South East Asia. There is a past and a future to discuss. “Islam and the West” is straight out 19th century Orientalism, laden with a subtext that is best left to warmongers. Peace requires a different idiom.

We understood your problem as you weaved through political and rhetorical swamps, because your predecessor managed to achieve what the mightiest of Muslim rulers failed to do – unite Muslims, albeit against him rather than for something. But every Muslim does not need a homily on democracy. Muslims of Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh and India, who add up to nearly half the Muslim population, are not democracy-deficit.

The appropriate venue for a speech on Islam would have been Mecca, Medina or Jerusalem. But the first two cities are barred to non-Muslims or apostates; and the third would have been too toxic for an American President.

Cairo was the perfect podium for the speech that we did hear, since your true theme was not the “Muslim world” but the region between the Nile and the Indus, which I have, elsewhere, called the “Arc of Turbulence”. Those searching for a convenient caption for the Cairo oration might want to call it the “Nildus Speech”.

For the citizens of this region between Egypt and Pakistan, and particularly for Muslims, this was a brilliant gleam in the gloom to which they have become accustomed. Its great merit was justice and fairness, virtues that are repeatedly exalted in the Holy Quran. You did not deny Palestine its rights because you wanted to preserve what Israel has acquired. Of course you will be criticized for being even-handed, but you have survived worse.

It was extremely important that a President of the United States quoted the Quran’s unequivocal condemnation of terrorism, through a verse that is particularly beautiful. This will go a long way to correct the propaganda unleashed by those who controlled the White House and influenced media before you.

There was one element of your speech that did address almost the whole of the Muslim world: your stark, unambiguous condemnation of gender bias, one of the besetting sins of the “Muslim world”. If Muslims do not eliminate gender bias, they will not be permitted into the 20th century: who is going to send them an invitation to join the 21st? Barack Obama has offered the key, but it is up to Muslims to open the door.

As you will see from my name and designation I am an Indian and a Muslim. I am also very proud of the Islamic heritage of South Asia, its diversity and richness and the contribution that Muslims have made not only to the evolution of India’s culture of which it has become and remains so intrinsic a part. I therefore wished you to know of the deep appreciation that I and many others here in India have for your efforts to reach out to the world’s Muslims and end a confrontation that was so unnecessary and indeed so grievously debilitating to humanity’s quest for a future of peace and harmony.

I have today made so bold as to address this letter to you, to express my discomfort with the use of the term ‘Muslim World.’ The use of this term is true not only of the NYT headline that I have quoted but seems also to have been the substance of a statement made by White House spokesman Mr. Gibbs.

Why am I as a Muslim of India uncomfortable with this terminology? On the one hand, by characterizing what are no more than different aspects of our world in these terms implying something separate, one will unwittingly give weight to a concept of ‘us’ and ‘them’, with all its grievous consequences. On the other, what world am I, a Muslim of India, a country with the second largest population of Muslims in the world, to consider myself part of?

In conclusion therefore Mr. President my plea to you is that we consider the world a unified entity with all the many ethnic and religious groups that constitute it being components of a larger whole. The Muslims would, as you would well know, like to regard themselves as a community, an ‘ummah.’ This is just as there is a Christian community and a Buddhist and Hindu. But these are all diverse in themselves and the richer for it. Let us then reach out to each other simply as Christians to Muslims and Muslims to Hindus and so on of our own world, not to those from another world. Then every part of this world can begin working together to enrich itself and so strengthen this world, which is ours to share.

The discourse between Islam and the West as we know very well has been loaded with enormous historical baggage. It remains so today. What it tells us is that in as much as the interpretations of history differ and diverge so do the perceptions about Islam and the West. Today, regardless of George Bush, there continues to be a clash of interpretations on the subject.

Globalization, in principle, at least requires that we overcome that which divides us. In the coming decades humanity must find ways to overcome the immense challenges of climate change, poverty and the drying up of energy resources. Sustainable development of the vast majority of the world’s population remains a significant challenge, particularly in times of recession. These are problems of monumental proportion and are best solved as a community of nations working together.

Barack Obama has assumed the office of the President of the United States at a moment when the relationship between Islam and the West is among the most important political and social issues in the world. We see in him a leader committed to the values of freedom and democracy, and a president who believes that the critical issues dividing the United States and the Muslim world can be resolved not through fiery rhetoric and bellicose language but by positive engagement in a language of mutual respect.

His administration has made some positive moves in its early days. A tangible end to the Arab-Israeli conflict is not yet visible; however, the appointment of George Mitchell as Middle East envoy is a welcome step. The language of fairness and balance now injected into this long-standing conflict by Obama in recent days is a welcome respite from previous administrations. America’s anticipated withdrawal from Iraq, though delayed, is well regarded, as is a rethinking of its approach in Afghanistan. The opening of the books, so to speak, on torture and detainee abuse is a painful and cathartic process. A proper accounting of the abuses, as well as the closure of Guantanamo Bay, will go far in helping the US to regain its international credibility.

While President Obama has espoused a message of peace he must nevertheless contend with issues of nuclear proliferation and terrorism. His message of engagement and dialogue resonates with the vast population of Muslims now living in Europe and the United States. But integration evokes powerful emotions. Thanks no doubt to the historical baggage and the heavy load of prejudices that come along with it, Turkey has not found it easy in its bid to join the European Union. France and England have faced violent riots emanating from the ghettoized populations of Muslims who now call the major European population centers their own homes. The furor that erupted over the Danish cartoons reflects both the deplorable condition of Muslim-West relations and the challenges we still face in developing a language of mutual respect with which to engage both sides.

While I would continue no doubt to advocate that Europe and the United States pursue an open door policy in promoting freedom and democracy, I must once again say that the conviction to move from autocracy to democracy must emanate from the Muslim countries themselves.

Even if we are agreed that Muslims must be committed to change, the question that remains is how we can proceed. Real engagement must be inclusive. We should not start by building a wall around ourselves, setting preconditions, and prejudging groups and parties. These impediments only serve to strengthen old prejudices and further sow suspicion and doubt. If the notion of the universalism of Islam is to mean anything, it would require that its values of justice, compassion and tolerance be practiced everywhere. Can we remain blind to the injustice perpetrated in non-Muslim countries? Should we not also relate to the suffering of other minorities in Muslim countries? And our condemnation against the violation of human rights must transcend race, colour or creed. But we should do well to remember that no nation, no region, and no culture or religion has a monopoly on the values of freedom, justice and human dignity. If we seek to engage in dialogue between Islam and the West that is meaningful, then let it be based on these universal principles that we all share.

It is true that the existence of extremists in Muslim countries is no figment of the imagination, but they are by products of a society without accountability, freedom or democracy. These are states led by autocrats who have received financial and military support of the democratic West, particularly America. Obama’s efforts in this regard ought to be directed towards formulating policies that achieve America’s strategic objectives without compromising the democratic forces in the Muslim world. Support for regimes that cannot be held accountable to their own citizens is recipe for long-term failure despite the possibility of short-term gains. There should be no more equivocal actions and the foreign policy of selective ambivalence must end.

It cannot be easy to be an unmitigated cynic when it comes to President Barack Obama. His speech to the Muslim world in Cairo was unexceptional because with Obama, the expectation now is that he will continue to raise the extremely high standards that he has already set. He did just that. This speech will be remembered for a number of different things.

As he has done so boldly, but so carefully since 2004, Obama’s chose to make the central appeal of his speech to Muslims, a moral appeal. He used the words “should” and “must” a total of 43 times. This moral reasoning, whether it was to argue for freedom to speak, to believe or to dress, was universal. He didn’t just argue for Muslims to accept the reality of the Holocaust, or for non-Muslims to not be illiberal about the Hijab-he argued for universal values that are a part of a human tradition-the freedom to think and believe and express oneself.

The speech wove an American agenda in the Muslim world in moral language that is going to be very difficult for both Daniel Pipes and for Ayman Al Zwahiri to demonize. Yet whether they do it individually, or institutionally, agencies and institutions that trade in intolerance and negativity will try.

Hezbollah was quick to point out that Muslims didn’t need a moral sermon from Obama. But the joke is on Hezbollah. Obama’s already established street cred in the Muslim world means that in fact he is quite a good source of a sermon. Especially one that quotes intelligently and liberally, from the Holy Quran, and especially because too few of the Muslim world’s leaders, whether it is Hosni Mubarak, or Asif Ali Zardari, have any kind of moral authority to quote from the Holy Book, and be taken seriously. How telling of the crisis of leadership in the Muslim world, that Barack Obama is a more credible quoter from the Quran than any living Muslim leader?

Obama’s focus on the Muslim world’s youth was palpable, and brilliant. Facebook and Twitter were awash in translations and transcriptions of all kinds. Like his campaign for President, Obama’s campaign for peace in the Muslim world already has more grassroots cred than the often sad and weak attempts to be hip, made by leaders and representatives of Muslim countries.

Writers and intellectuals in the Muslim world often lament America’s weak and myopic understanding of their countries and culture. Yet, Obama demonstrated a depth of appreciation for what drives the hearts, minds and souls of ordinary Muslims by referring to the common bonds of people and their appetite for confidence in the rule of law, and government that doesn’t steal from the people.

The US foreign policy establishment and its glacial speed is no match for the campaign mode of Obama and his team. That is unfortunate. In his speech, Obama began a dialogue that should have long been a core pillar of America’s approach to Muslims-an alliance with the people, rather than the patrons and pilferers that oppress them. That this journey began in Egypt is no kind of contradiction at all. Sooner rather than later, when Hosni Mubarak punches the clock, a new democracy in Egypt will emerge. It will invariably be influenced by a reformed, reframed and post-modern Muslim Brotherhood. By appealing to morality, to youth and to the universality of God, President Obama made the task of future American leaders and diplomats in Egypt and around the Muslim world, just a little bit easier.

As symbolism goes, this was quite symbolic. Obama could have spoken from the Azhar University, the premier Islamic educational institution, rather than Cairo University, but Azhar was a ‘joint host,, and he did visit the Sultan Hassan mosque where the mufti of Egypt often gives the Friday sermon.

This speech was of two parts: the first spoke of general issues. Obama recalled how Islam carried the light of enlightenment in the West, how Islam and the US are not exclusive to one another, and how they shared very much. Here, as at the end of his speech, he was very convincing as someone who believed that a relationship based on mutual interest and mutual respect could be a reality and should be a reality.

The second part was about topics: there were a couple he mentioned by way of the preamble, such as attacking Islamophobia and upholding the right of Muslim women to wear the hijab if they so chose (which will be heard badly in many parts of Europe). Then he mentioned 7 topics: violent extremism (and he did not use words like jihadis), the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Iran, democracy promotion, religious freedom, women’s rights, and economic development.

On the other topics: he pulled it off on ‘violent extremism,’ covering Iraq & Afghanistan sufficiently and without any surprises. He did particularly well on the issue of democracy: the words he used will make it very uncomfortable for all undemocratic governments, including Arab ones.

On nuclear weapons, he warned Iran, as well as issuing a promise to seek a world without nuclear weapons. But he is going to have make that more than just words. Democracy encouragement – what will that mean for all countries in the Muslim world? The eradication of nuclear weapons all over the world?

The key topic, and the one he spoke on more than the rest, was the one people were most interested in hearing: the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. He will have annoyed many in the Muslim world by drawing attention to the Holocaust – a Holocaust that the Muslim world was not responsible for or engaged in. He will have made the Israelis feel very much out on a limb by insisting on a Palestinian state and a rejection of settlements. But he did not bring up two of the major issues of the conflict: the status of Jerusalem and the refugee problem.

The entire Muslim world was probably watching this, and perhaps there was an emphasis on the Arab world more than its demographic warrants. But, after all, this is about fault lines, and it is in the Arab world fault lines most exist. All in all, one has to recall: frankly speaking, neither Bush, nor Obama’s defeated opponent in the presidential election, are likely to have ever said words like Obama did in Cairo. His quotations from the Qur’an and his general demeanour may have won him goodwill and optimism from the Muslim world; they will now be waiting for him to put ideas into action.

President Obama’s message to the Muslim world was: “Ask not what America can do for you, but ask what you can do for yourselves and your own countries.” The President’s speech was remarkable and historic, proving that he is the best ambassador the United States has to the Muslim world. Muslim communities worldwide will see this opportunity as re-defining relations with America, ridding ourselves from historical baggage. Difficult yes, but today there’s a ray of hope.

His message of reform within the Muslim world will not be dismissed as it has been when previous presidents spoke to Muslim audiences. He discussed the isolation of extremists while partnering with Muslim communities as an important pivot in his foreign policy. It’s a new era for US Muslim World relations.

The stage set for the President of the United States of America marked a turning point for US-Muslim World relations. Cairo was the place, a former capital of the Muslim world, a capital of culture and political influence, a bridge between not only the US and Muslim countries, but between Asia and Africa. He spoke from a university, not a government building, he connected between society and religion in the Muslim World. He welcomed the co-sponsorship of Al-Azhar, where Sheikh Muhammad Abdu preached reform over a century ago.

The private chatter of world leaders, including those in our own country, must be expressed to the public, and their public posturing must end to address real concerns of their peoples, moving forward to serve human needs. Otherwise, their days in politics are numbered.

If I were Palestinian, I see the opportunity in this president the reality of a Palestinian state. He referred to Palestine’s existence as something that cannot be denied, just as Israel’s existence cannot be denied. If I were Israeli, I see the opportunity in this president one who can explain the Jewish narrative to Muslims worldwide and help in lasting security for Israel. President Obama maybe the only one standing in Washington calling for a two state solution, as the Congress and the Beltway has pretty much given up on hope for the peace process. But he is a powerful voice with a growing American and global constituency.

The right wing in America calls him an apologist. The extremists in the Muslim world call him soft or rhetoric without action. In actuality, the two are in the same camp now, and President Barack Obama is leading a bus for peace and prosperity. If we achieve peace in the Middle East, there will be peace dividends for all of us, let alone the moral satisfaction of reducing tensions and improving human relations.

Presdent Barack Obama dealt a blow to bin Laden today. The President spoke to the Muslim peoples and articulated his respect for Islam and the contributions of Muslims to world civilization. We can expect more from bin Laden, but we can also have hope that his voice will become irrelevant and the voice of the moderate mainstream will be the barometer for Islam’s role in global affairs.

It is now the responsibility of Muslim Americans to form constituencies for the peace process, along with Christians and Jews. Now more than ever there is a need for Abrahamic faiths to create a new paradigm for cooperation beginning in America. Otherwise, the President’s speech will be just another great speech. Worse yet, we, Muslims and Jews will be blamed for missing this opportunity to work together in cooperation for America’s interests. We must be pro-America, not pro-Israel or pro-Palestinian in our orientation. It’s time to engage the other, especially with those whom we disagree.

It seems so simple when President Obama says it. You listen to him and you say, “Of course!” He knows it too. His greatest talent is to be able to confront the truth in a manner that manages not to offend, even if one does not like that truth.

He says “this cycle of suspicion and discord must end.” He takes the first step. He says what everyone who has dealt with problems in the Middle East knows to be true. People do not say what they really mean to each other. Recently at a Brookings conference in Doha on Islam I found myself going to panel after panel listening to people of all faiths express their views. Then over meals, many would say exactly the opposite when they had no fear of being recorded. Obama addressed this head on. “I am convinced that in order to move forward, we must say openly the things we hold in our hearts, and that too often are said only behind closed doors. And he quotes the Koran, “Be conscious of God and speak always the truth.” “That is what I will try to do – to speak the truth as best I can…” he said. Later he would add, “America…will say in public what we say in private to Israelis and Palestinians and Arabs. We cannot impose peace. But privately, many Muslims recognize that Israel will not go away. Likewise, many Israelis recognize the need for a Palestinian state. It is time for us to act on what everyone knows to be true.”

More importantly, Obama is not afraid of religion. He is completely comfortable talking about it. He has no religious prejudice. He is totally pluralistic. He is knowledgeable about religions other than his own, and he is, and this is the key word, respectful. Often, leaders who harbour suspicions or lack of understanding toward other faiths will engage in platitudes rather than take a chance on alienating anyone. Not this president. He knows that without understanding religious issues there is no chance of accomplishing anything near peace.

He can say assalaamu alaykum and make it sound as if he had not been standing in front of a mirror practicing all day. He can talk about zakat, Muslim charity, with ease. He can quote the Koran, the Bible and the Talmud with equal enthusiasm. He can honor Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed, by saying “peace be upon them” without being self conscious.

His speech was clearly directed toward Muslim. This was, however, not a speech about religion or policy. It was a speech about understanding and respect. He addressed every key issue unflinchingly. But by combining his comfort and knowledge of religion and confronting the often difficult truths about the politics he showed Muslims and the rest of the world what true respect really is.

The President’s Cairo speech articulated a powerful case for the “mutual interest and mutual respect” that should form the basis of U.S. relations with the Muslim world. In making that case, though, he missed an important opportunity by not reiterating his commitment to lead for peace in Sudan, where 2.7 million Muslim civilians have been driven from their homes in the Darfur region and hundreds of thousands have perished because of violence orchestrated by the Sudanese government. Public polling in Islamic countries conducted by Zogby International on behalf of the Arab-American Institute found a strong sense of solidarity with and feeling of responsibility towards the Muslim population in Darfur, with strong majorities (over 80 percent in Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Turkey) saying that “since the Sudanese in Darfur are Muslim, other Muslim nations should intervene to stop the violence and help negotiate a settlement.” This concern mirrors the broad public concern in the United States. President Obama could have appealed to this shared concern and asked all governments in the region and around the world to join him in offering a choice to Khartoum between concrete progress towards peace, which will result in improved relations, or continued obstructionism and use of violence, which will lead to increased isolation.

The president’s own interest in Darfur and Sudan is well-documented. In language he echoed today, he has described genocide as a “stain on our souls,” and he has said that ending it in Darfur should be a top foreign policy priority for the United States. Now is the time to follow through with an aggressive focus on coordinated diplomacy with other key players.

There’s not a unilateral solution to Sudan’s interlocking crises. But presidential leadership can make a difference now more than ever and can be part of reaching out constructively to the Muslim world, if the president and his team will seize the chance to launch a coordinated and intensive multilateral effort.","June 4, 2009",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
43,Challenges to inclusive education for girls with disabilities in Tigray,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/challenges-to-inclusive-education-for-girls-with-disabilities-in-tigray/,Mebrahtom Tesfahunegn,"Ensuring inclusive education is crucial not only for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and contributing to global GDP, but also for upholding education as a fundamental human right and an indispensable means for realizing other human rights. In Ethiopia, enrollment rates for learners with disabilities remain alarmingly low. This issue is particularly pronounced in Tigray, a region severely impacted by a war that disproportionately impacted people with disabilities, school infrastructure, and educational materials and assistive technologies like hearing aids and computers with screen readers.

Over the past 5 months as an Echidna Global Scholar, I have undertaken research to understand the barriers and supports affecting access, learning, and participation for girls with disabilities living in high-poverty communities within post-conflict Tigray. The findings of the research help identify gaps in current policies and provide actionable insights to enhance the effective implementation of inclusive education policies.

On this end of the continuum, girls are locked in their homes and/or are prevented from going to school. My research shows that this is due to stigma, extreme poverty, and/or physical barriers. Teachers, directors, and students reported that many girls with disabilities are forced to spend their lives hidden behind doors because of fear of community criticism, as disability is still considered a “curse,” and parents keep girls away from the eyes of the community so they will not bring “shame” to the family. Respondents and participants revealed that fear of sexual violence, rape, or forced marriage—especially prevalent in contexts of high poverty and conflict—is also reported to lead families to isolate girls with disabilities for their own “protection.”

In Tigray, particularly in hard-to-reach areas characterized by extreme poverty, families are unable to afford necessities like food for their daughters with disabilities. In these cases, the costs of uniforms, educational materials, and school fees keep girls with disabilities out of school.

Many girls with disabilities are further denied access to education due to inaccessible school facilities and the physical challenges they face in commuting to and from school. For students living far from schools, the journey is fraught with obstacles like gorges, cliffs, valleys, ditches, and rocky terrain. This is particularly pronounced for those traveling on foot due to the lack of transportation services. Construction work along school routes often creates additional hazards. These changes in the landscape can cause girls to sustain injuries, increasing the risk of additional disabilities or even life-threatening harm.

Girls with disabilities who are present in school are often told—through words or actions—that they cannot or should not participate in school activities. They report being excluded from school activities on the basis of the belief that they are “inferior” to nondisabled students. A key informant from the civil society sector shared that some teachers treat girls with disabilities as objects of sympathy, which they feel results in unequal treatment, lowered expectations, and fewer opportunities for meaningful participation. A school director also described how teachers suggest segregation instead of inclusion, generalizing that girls with disabilities “lack” necessary skills and abilities.

Additionally, girls with disabilities often face prejudice and discrimination from their peers in school environments. This mistreatment was described by parents and girls as frequently including physical abuse, insults, social exclusion, theft of educational materials, and discouragement. These acts of bias and discrimination may come from fellow students, even other girls with disabilities, leaving them feeling discouraged and demoralized. The research revealed that discriminatory and demoralizing attitudes toward students with disabilities also persist among some parents of students without disabilities, who might refuse, for example, to allow their children to study alongside students with disabilities.

The girls and teachers included in this study stated that lack of support from the educational bureau and school administrators was a key barrier to meaningful learning, even when girls were in schools. Girls with disabilities reported that school administrators refused to provide accommodations that could significantly improve their learning experience, like allowing additional time for note-taking, providing tutorial classes, moving students with disabilities from the back to the front of the class, or relocating classrooms from upper floors to ground-level rooms. Such refusals reflect an ongoing lack of commitment to creating an inclusive and supportive learning environment at the government and school leadership levels.

In addition, we found that inadequate learning materials, insufficient teacher training, and limited budget allocation impeded learning for these girls. Many girls and teachers reported that the lack of inclusive learning materials, such as Braille and sign language interpreters, severely limited girls’ ability to engage in learning activities. The shortage of teachers trained in inclusive education was also considered a significant pedagogical barrier. Teachers who participated in the research revealed that in Tigray, there are very few teachers with special education training; most schools in this study lacked such trained professionals altogether. Even when trained teachers were available, they were often assigned to teach nondisabled students, leaving them with limited time and resources to support girls with disabilities. Whether trained in special education or not, school directors admitted that most teachers lacked the time and skills to adapt the curriculum to meet the needs of students with disabilities.

Lastly, the government budget does not support inclusive education for girls with disabilities. The current monthly budget allocated for both boys and girls with disabilities is only 14 Birr (approximately $0.11) per student with disabilities. This amount is insufficient to provide the types of supports that would guarantee provision of assistive technologies and paid readers. The shortage of funding also inhibits schools’ capacity to make facilities accessible for girls with physical disabilities and to provide supplementary aids and services for girls with intellectual disabilities. Research respondents, including key informants from the educational bureau, confirmed that the budgets allocated by the federal, regional, and district-level governments are inadequate to make education truly inclusive for girls with disabilities in the region.

Despite the aforementioned barriers, there are insufficient efforts to improve inclusive education from parents, community, students, teachers, school administration, and government. Hence, ensuring access to education for girls with disabilities by eliminating physical, societal, and economic barriers to schooling is necessary by specifically taking the following steps:","December 18, 2024",Brookings Institution,race prejudice

Moderators Nicol Turner Lee and Darrell West speak with experts and policymakers to share data, ideas, and policy solutions that address the challenges of our digital world.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become ubiquitous in this digital age. However, AI today exists with inherent biases, particularly those deployed for use in the areas of finance, employment, law enforcement, and housing. The use of AI in such sectors has exacerbated societal prejudices. For example, the adoption of facial recognition by law enforcement has led to wrongful convictions of innocent individuals of color due to AI technology’s inaccuracies and biases. Such biases are products of historical inequities, and must be regulated by policies aimed at safeguarding the rights of marginalized groups. Can civil rights and algorithmic systems coexist? Can they coexist equitably? This week on the TechTank Podcast, we revisit a relevant-as-ever discussion from 2022 on civil rights and artificial intelligence. On this episode co-host Nicol Turner Lee is joined by Renee Cummings, a nonresident senior fellow at Brookings and data activist in residence and criminologist at the University of Virginia’s School of Data Science, along with Lisa Rice, president and CEO of the National Fair Housing Alliance. Together, they conduct a thorough exploration of these complex issues and provide valuable insights into addressing the urgent issue of equitable AI.

Tokyo 2014 Shine Weeks Event at Saitama,” an event hosted by Josai University in Saitama Prefecture.  This event was one of the activities held in conjunction with the World Assembly for Women in Tokyo.

Thank you very much, Governor Ueda, for all the work that Saitama Prefecture is doing to advance the economic participation of women. I appreciate very much, Chancellor Mizuta, your kind invitation to come to Josai University and I want to thank everyone in the audience for a very warm welcome.

These are exciting times in Japan. We are all watching a national dialogue take place on how to realize the potential of women, on how to ensure that women can make meaningful contributions in all areas of society. This is a dialogue based on a fundamental insight: excluding half of its population is a self-defeating proposition, and the future of Japan is tied to the goal of fully realizing the potential of its women.

46,A revolution of values for Black American families,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-revolution-of-values-for-black-american-families/,Andre M. Perry,"When talking about Black American families, we’ve all heard someone say this not-so-subtle dig: It all starts at home. The phrase suggests that if we could just fix Black mothers and fathers to be responsible like white, middle-class families, we wouldn’t have any problems.

False narratives such as this one help normalize a hierarchy of human value that leads to an investment into whiteness. Since the Moynihan Report was published in 1965, researchers and journalists have continued framing poverty mainly as a function of individual choices. The report offered a robust structural analysis, but it set a dangerous precedent by identifying Black people not living up to white middle-class ideals as a central problem. This falls in line with the white supremacist myth claiming that harsh conditions in many Black communities are the result of Black people’s collective choices and moral failings.

One of the major goals of my new book, Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America’s Black Cities, is to show that there is nothing wrong with Black people that ending racism can’t solve. Presumptions of Black people’s unworthiness undercut efforts to invest in Black-majority neighborhoods.

47,Many Rivers to Cross Documents African-American History from Juan Garrido to Barack Obama,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/many-rivers-to-cross-documents-african-american-history-from-juan-garrido-to-barack-obama/,Fred Dews,"Brookings hosted Henry Louis Gates, Jr. to preview and discuss his new documentary, The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross. After watching segments of the film, panelists discussed issues ranging from affirmative action in education, educational attainment, and economic disparities in the African-American community.

Gates, along with Senior Fellows Isabel Sawhill and Ron Haskins, Guest Scholar Lois Dickson Rice, and moderator Glenn Hutchins, vice chair of the Brookings Board of Trustees, explored the nuances in these issues, including class divides between black and white communities and also within the black community.

When asked if he had benefited from affirmative action, Gates noted that the Class of ’66 at Yale had six black men to graduate; the class “that entered with me had 96 … I never would have gotten in without affirmative action … but it meant that we were allowed for the first time to compete on a more or less level playing field with white kids. Before, there was a strict quota.”

Rice, who lived in segregated rooming at Radcliffe College, said that race and economic issues are “always synonymous,” and told the audience that her Jamaican immigrant parents had a motto: “Don’t ever try to use race as an excuse, nor as an advantage.”

the black upper middle class has quadrupled since 1968 but black children living at or beneath the poverty line is almost identical to what it was, mid 30%, when Dr. King died. — Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

Sawhill said that “there are a whole lot of people in America, younger people particularly, who don’t know this history, don’t know what it used to be like, and therefore need to see this kind of historical piece.”

She also spoke to the role of affirmative action in education and the new case before the U.S. Supreme Court. The questions we should be debating, she said, are: “How long do we need affirmative action—I hope not forever—and secondly, what about class versus race?” Speaking to the sharply-growing class divide, Sawhill said that “the African-Americans who are getting left behind tend to be on the lower part of our social and economic structure. They’re the ones I think we should be worried about the most.”

Haskins noted the divisiveness of the affirmative action issue in society, but said that its advantages outweigh the disadvantages. “We’d still be integrating lunch counters if it hadn’t been for government,” he said. But there is still discrimination, he said, concluding that “I think affirmative action is going to be a part of our culture for many years to come.”

Discussion turned to the issue of a black middle class. Sawhill pointed out the racial gaps that persist in the data, demonstrated by lifecycle mobility models such as the Social Genome Project. “There is a lot more falling back amongst African Americans than there is amongst whites even after you’ve achieved this middle-class status,” she said. Haskins, turning to the question of welfare, said that this illustrates the importance of individual decisions. “Individuals make decisions that really reverberate in their future and shape their future to a large extent … until these decisions about having babies, getting married and work change, we’re not going to make great progress.”

Gates noted the divide in wealth within the black community. “We have two nations, both black. So there’s a wealth gap between black and white and there’s a wealth gap between black and black.” Affirmative action, Gates said, “was a class escalator for us” but now “we are perpetuating our class status through affirmative action. … I would even say my kids don’t need affirmative action.”

It would be savvy politically to include an economic element [to affirmative action] because that would appeal broadly across society. I don’t think we can keep playing the slavery card … it’s real but you gotta move on. — Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

Sawhill referred to research in the Brown Center for Education Policy and the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity that are showing “that there is a lot of … undermatching” — meaning academically qualified African Americans who, because they lack certain connections and knowledge, are prepared academically but are not going to the kinds of institutions they should be going to. “This work is showing that we still have a problem here … it’s a much more nuanced problem than outright prejudice and discrimination.”

“The fact is,” Haskins said, “that both low income kids and black kids and many Hispanic kids come to the schools at age 5 or 6, depending on their state, already behind.”

So it follows from that I think that until we do something during the preschool period with parents and with better preschool programs and more …. access for low income kids and minority kids we are not going to be able to do it with schools alone. … The parents and the preschool programs are the two keys.","October 15, 2013",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
48,Detention of Terrorism Suspects in Britain and France,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/detention-of-terrorism-suspects-in-britain-and-france/,Jeremy Shapiro,"Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I’ve spent the last several years trying to glean lessons from Europe’s long and troubled history with terrorism. I think it is a worthwhile effort and I commend this commission for this effort on the issue of detention.

The problem of creating a system of norms and laws for detaining terrorism suspects has been a challenge for every democratic government that has faced a terrorist threat. The system of detention established in the United States after 9/11 has come under much justifiable criticism, but we should not infer from those errors that the U.S. government did not correctly identify an inadequacy in existing laws and practice. Terrorism always challenges existing legal regimes. One result is that effective and accepted standards for the detention of terrorism suspects are not well defined by the laws of war, by international human rights law, or by the domestic law of any democratic country that I have studied. Each democratic country that has faced a terrorist threat has struggled with precisely these issues; most have made very serious errors, embarked on policies that they later repudiated, and engaged in a long, painful process of reform. There are no silver bullets in the experience of other countries.

It is also moreover the case that the threat and the domestic situation in every country are unique and policies cannot simply be transferred from one context to another. One other general lesson, however, does emerge quite strongly from the experience of other democratic countries. Counterterrorism measures, including those regarding detention, need to be rooted in pre-existing notions of law and fairness and they need to have broad support across the political spectrum. In the face of an imminent threat or after an attack, there is always pressure to act quickly and forcefully. But this is a long-term struggle and the record shows that ad-hoc anti-terrorist measures that have little basis in societal values and shallow support in public opinion will not only oppress individual citizens, but they will ultimately fail, even by the standard of preventing future terrorist actions.

With those general lessons in mind, I think it will be useful to look at the experience of two of America’s closest allies, France and Britain.

France has a long and painful history with terrorism. In the 1960s, the French struggled with both left- and right-wing terrorism stemming from the Algerian War of Independence; in the 1970s, they suffered through attacks by Palestinian terrorists led by Carlos the Jackal; in the 1980s they faced persistent bomb attacks in Paris from groups sponsored by Iran and Syria; and in the 1990s, they dealt fairly effectively with the first deadly stirrings of the Islamist threat, including a 1994 attempt to fly a hijacked airliner into the Eiffel Tower.

French counterterrorism is firmly rooted in the criminal justice system; French officials emphasize that they do use extrajudicial or administrative measures. This commitment reflects some hard-won experience. During the 1960s, De Gaulle created a quasi-military court, Le Cour de Surête de l’Etat (the State Security Court) to try national security cases. The court was composed of three civilian judges and two military officers; it conducted trials in secret and offered no right of appeal. While that court was reasonably effective at its immediate task, it was very controversial and seen as a creature of the political party that created it. It lacked the legitimacy of a normal judicial procedure that could sustain it through the inevitable lulls in France’s struggle against terrorism. When the opposition socialists came to power in 1981, during a time of diminished terrorist threat, they eliminated the State Security Court.

The current system was developed after the terrorist threat returned to France in the mid-1980s. Although based in the criminal justice system, counterterrorism in France recognizes the special nature of the terrorist crime and creates exceptional and flexible procedures in law for terrorist cases. In the view of the French legal scholar Antoine Garapon, it is precisely the flexibility of the French legal system that has eliminated the need to resort to extrajudicial measures. The French also take a self-consciously pre-emptive approach—they intend to stop terrorist attacks before they happen, not simply prosecute afterwards. They seem to be fairly good at this—there have been no serious terrorist attacks in France since 1996 despite several attempts and despite the frequent denunciations of France by Islamist terrorist groups, including al-Qa’eda.

Detention is an important part of this pre-emptive system. It’s important to note that the French system of justice is based on an inquisitorial approach in which an investigating magistrate (an inexact translation of juge d’instruction) conducts a judicial investigation of serious criminal offenses. The investigating magistrate, somewhat of a cross between a prosecutor and a judge, has no precise analogue in the Anglo-Saxon system of justice. He is not an advocate for the prosecution or the defense, but rather he is charged with conducting an impartial investigation to determine whether a crime worthy of a prosecution has been committed. Because these magistrates are in theory impartial arbiters, they are granted fairly wide powers to open judicial inquiries, authorize search warrants and wiretaps, and issue subpoenas¾powers that in the U.S. would require authorization from a judge. There are seven investigating magistrates in France that handle all of the terrorism cases in the country. In practice, the terrorism magistrates are not impartial investigators, they act like prosecutors but have the powers of a judge—a fact often noted by human rights advocates.

The investigating magistrate can make use of two types of detention, both highly regulated within the judicial system: pre-charge detention (garde à vue) and pre-trial detention (détention provisoire). In normal cases, pre-charge detention is allowed for 24 hours, extendible once. But if the case involves terrorism or a few other serious crimes, the investigating magistrates can authorize pre-charge detention for four days and, under some circumstances, six days. Suspects are not entitled to see their lawyer until after 72 hours, and even then the lawyer is usually only allowed 30 minutes with the suspect. The suspect can usually notify his representatives of his arrest, but that privilege can be denied by the prosecutor if he believes it might prejudice investigations and it often is in terrorism cases. He is also not notified of his right to silence and can be interrogated without his lawyer present. As noted, the limitation of these rights is justified by the supposed impartiality of the investigating magistrate who is not considered an advocate for the prosecution.

If the investigating magistrate recommends that the suspect be charged, he may also recommend pre-trial detention. Such detention is by law recommended only if it is necessary to preserve material evidence, prevent witness pressure, prevent flight, or to protect the accused, but it is quite common in terrorism cases. Pre-trial detention can last for up to four years in terrorism cases with the investigating magistrate effectively determining the pace of the investigation and therefore the trial. Alternatively, the investigating magistrates can also decide on house arrest and other limitations, such as bail or the surrender of a passport. There were some well-publicized abuses of pre-trial detention in terrorism cases during the 1990s, so since 2001, all pre-trial detentions must be approved by a new type of independent magistrate, the Liberty and Detention Judge (juge des libertés et de la detention). That judge must also hold a hearing every four or six months (depending on the charge) to re-authorize pre-trial detention in which he insures that that the investigation and trial are progressing at a reasonable pace.

There have been many allegations of torture taking place during detentions, particularly of the use of extended questioning periods and sleep deprivation, but no accusation of systematic abuse. In response, France created in 2007 an independent authority for the monitoring of all places of detention, the Inspector General of Places of Deprivation of Liberty (Controleur Général des lieux de privation de liberté), but it is not yet operational. There are also controls in place to ensure that the suspects are seen by doctors at various points in the process.

French counterterrorism officials view both types of detentions as critical to their success. The ability to hold essentially anybody for four days and to hold charged suspects for four years gives them ample opportunity to assemble a case. The investigating magistrates have occasionally chafed at the short pre-charge detention period, gaining an increase to six days under exceptional circumstances in 2006. But they consider the ability to question suspects for three days without a lawyer as critical and usually sufficient to obtain information about terrorist networks. In the 1990s, there were many instances of mass arrest (50-100 people) for preventative and intelligence purposes, including before the 1998 World Cup in Paris in which people would be arrested in what were essentially sweeps. That technique is no longer used, but the pre-charge detention period is still clearly used as an investigative technique in a more individualized fashion. The investigating magistrates also see the pre-trial detention as allowing them the time to assemble evidence from multiple sources, and to find alternatives sources for intelligence information that can’t be used in trial.

This system of detention has been roundly criticized by human rights organizations within and beyond France, including in a highly critical report by Human Rights Watch released this month. The role of the investigating magistrates is broadly condemned as too powerful and lacking in procedural checks, even after the reforms to create a Liberty and Detention Judge. Certainly, by American standards, the French counterterrorism apparatus is extraordinarily repressive and intrusive and this repression falls particularly on specific groups, primarily Muslims and Corsicans. During the wave of terrorist attacks in 1995, French authorities detained some 70,000 people for questioning; the vast majority of them were North African.

Given these facts, the criticism of the system, including of detention, in French civil society has been rather tepid. Attacks on counterterrorism enforcement in France have not generally emanated from Muslim civil society groups. There is very little talk about the degree to which this cadre of special anti-terrorism legislation contributes to the frictions between the Muslim community and the state—a debate which is almost glaring in its absence. The Muslim community in France apparently has bigger issues with which to contend—issues of cultural integration and economic opportunity, the plague of “normal” criminal activity in Muslim areas, and the debate over public religious expression. In this generally highly contentious environment, occasional counterterrorism actions that affect the Muslim population do not generate much public outcry from within the Muslim community. This fact that these measures are consistent with French traditions and firmly embedded in law helps to limit public disapproval.

As in France, the history of detention policy in the UK is a contentious one, but in the British case, the controversy continues. The backdrop for the current debate is the British experience in Northern Ireland, particularly during the 1970s. In response to the violence in Northern Ireland, the British introduced internment, essentially rounding up terrorism suspects in camps without recourse to any judicial process. In a manner similar to the U.S. government after 9/11, the British authorities at the time showed a deep lack of confidence in the courts, especially in the capacity of juries to confront the problem of terrorism and to persevere in an environment of intimidation (and also sympathy for many of the accused). Hundreds were rounded-up and interned. In part because the internees were overwhelmingly Catholics, the internment system was seen as biased and was very controversial. Internees were interrogated without trials and there were many accusations of torture. The system eventually collapsed under its own weight when a British Commission ruled that internment was contrary to British domestic law. The European Court of Human Rights later determined that the interrogation techniques were not torture but “amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment.” In retrospect, most scholars believe the internment policy accomplished little beyond helping the IRA with recruitment.

After this experience, the British government made a conscious effort beginning from the late 1970s to “criminalize” the terrorism problem. As Margaret Thatcher so eloquently put it, “a crime is a crime is a crime.” In a similar manner to France, they created special courts and rules of evidence, but made a conscious effort to model them on the existing criminal justice system and to apply criminal law to the special circumstances of the terrorist crime. Judges were able under this system to authorize detentions. The IRA resisted the criminal label and, in part because of continual abuses of the system in Northern Ireland, in part because it still did not meet the test of living up to British legal traditions, the system did not succeed in de-politicizing terrorism in Britain. It was gradually abandoned, although not finally until 2005.

As a result, the UK had still not found by 9/11 a method for detention that both comports with Britain legal traditions and its international obligations, and also meets the requirements of counterterrorism. In part, this is because the British system is more inflexible in its procedures than the French, but also it is because it doesn’t have the procedural options of the American system. Britain relies on a common law, adversarial system which means that the pace of the process is controlled throughout by the judge who is a neutral arbiter. The system permits post-charge questioning only in very limited circumstances and mostly rules out plea bargaining. The result is that gathering intelligence and evidence must take place before an arrest, or at least before the charge is laid. In practice, this means that questioning suspects can only be done in the limited pre-charge detention period. As the needs of intelligence on terrorism have mounted, the result has been a continual expansion of the pre-charge detention period

Originally, the pre-charge detention period was limited to 48 hours. It was extended in stages to 14 days (with a district judge’s approval) and then 28 days (with a high court judge’s approval). Currently, there is a bill before parliament to extend the period to 42 days for special circumstances (i.e. the Home Secretary declares an exceptionally grave terrorist threat.) The bill will also allow some post-charge questioning in terrorism cases for 24 hours, with five day extensions available with the authorization of a justice of the peace. Each of these extensions has occasioned greater controversy than the last—the 2006 Terrorism Act had originally sought a 90 day detention period, but this was scaled back to 28 days in response to parliamentary opposition.

The current situation is very shaky—the 42 day period will probably pass, but not without great controversy and thus with fairly shallow support. The government remains wedded to the project, insisting that the long detention periods are necessary for terrorism investigations, although they have presented no evidence that this is the case. They will probably seek even greater extensions if there is another terrorist attack in the United Kingdom. Eventually, the pre-charge detention period will run up against Britain’s European Charter of Human Rights (ECHR) Article 5 obligation to inform suspects “promptly” of the charges against them (if it has not already done so).

A separate but related issue concerns the British government’s efforts to detain foreign nationals without charge in a manner similar to that done by the US government in Guantanamo, albeit on a much smaller scale. The Anti-Terrorism Crimes and Security Act of 2001 permitted such detention of foreign nationals on suspicion of being international terrorists. It applied to those who could not be deported and could not be tried because the government claimed that doing so would reveal sensitive and dangerous intelligence. In 2004, the House of Lords ruled such detentions incompatible with Britain’s obligations under the ECHR Article 5, which forbids depriving any person of their liberty without due process of law. To avoid freeing suspected terrorists, the Prevention of Terrorism Act of 2005 replaced the detentions with a regime of “control orders” that was immediately applied to the ten individuals detained under the 2001 Act. The Act allows the Home Secretary to subject persons he reasonably suspects to be involved in terrorist activity, including British citizens, to a range of varied obligations including curfews, prohibition on arranged meetings with non-approved persons, prohibition on use of the internet or mobile phones, and a requirement to live at a specified address. Control orders that meet certain rather unclear standards are not considered deprivations of liberty under ECHR Article 5. This regime has also been immensely controversial and has only been applied to at most 16 individuals at a time.

The British case presents a cautionary tale. The British experience in Northern Ireland led them to seek legislative solutions rooted in criminal law to the problem of counterterrorism after 9/11, but they were unable to find solutions that met both the test of efficacy and the test of comporting with British legal traditions and their international human rights obligations. The result has been continuing controversy and a continuing lack, in the views of counterterrorism officials, of the necessary tools for combating terrorism in the United Kingdom. In part, this was because they were too reactive to attacks and failed to think creatively about what modifications to their legal system were most necessary and possible in the long term. But it is also because they began with a very serious lack of flexibility.","July 15, 2008",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
49,"Gender and Livelihoods among Internally Displaced Persons in Mindanao, Philippines",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/gender-and-livelihoods-among-internally-displaced-persons-in-mindanao-philippines/,Rufa Cagoco-Guiam,"Internal displacement has confronted Mindanao populations of the Philippines for more than five decades, dating back to the height of the so-called “Muslim-Christian conflict” in the early to mid-1970s. Displaced communities encounter a range of vulnerabilities as they face a whole new milieu in which their familiar systems of social protection, including livelihoods, are gone or fragmented due to forced evacuation.

This study on gender and livelihoods among internally displaced persons (IDPs) is based on fieldwork conducted from October to December 2012, in three areas in Central and Southern Mindanao (Notre Dame Village, Cotabato City; Datu Piang, Maguindanao Province; and Sitio Pananag, Barangay Lumasal, Maasim, Sarangani Province). Fieldwork data gathering techniques included key informant interviews with government officials and civil society leaders, as well as focus group discussions with “protracted” IDPs in the three areas.

War affects men and women differently, and this is perhaps most glaringly felt in the loss of livelihoods. Since men are the primary combatants in war, they are the first to disappear from the public sphere they used to move in as entrepreneurs, skilled workers, and merchants. Conscription into rebel or government groups or as parties to clan war forces men to abandon their economic responsibilities toward their families. In Mindanao, such a scenario has paved the way for women to assume leading economic roles, pushing them to navigate public spaces denied to them before conflict. But, assuming leading economic or even political roles does not automatically make displaced women empowered given that they are still expected to perform traditional nurturing roles. Instead, assuming breadwinning roles left by their husbands can often be a source of strain.

Young women and children in displaced communities are also vulnerable to human trafficking. Conflict-prone areas, such as the provinces in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, are major sources of trafficked victims. Predatory traffickers, including relatives of the women and children, look at them as a “resource” for capital generation, through recruitment to work abroad as domestic helpers or worse, as sex slaves.

For displaced men, the loss of livelihoods is often equated with their loss of face, as it renders them “powerless” to still be the breadwinners and economic leaders in their families.

Displaced men and women alike in the three areas studied tried to find ways and means to survive, either through attempts to restore former livelihoods or by accessing new ones. However, restoring former livelihoods is often not a viable option, as the enabling environment was absent in the place of evacuation. While opportunities to access new livelihoods in the place of displacement were essential to the displaced community’s survival, gender equity, particularly in terms of decision making and control of resources in relation to livelihoods, was still rare among IDPs.

Studies have shown that women have played crucial roles in the settlement of petty community conflicts, as well as in working toward more sustainable processes of conflict transformation, especially in the Mindanao context. When women manage cooperatives or lead local committees, such endeavors have greater chances of success than those run by men. In evacuation centers, internally displaced women are also the first to seek out assistance from various outside sources while the men typically “command” the women on what to do. Displaced women are also usually among the first who organize the community into different committees to manage the evacuation camp, especially with regards to the distribution of relief goods.

Key informants underlined that access to viable livelihoods enhances the enabling environment for peace. However, this depends on many factors, such as the types of livelihoods supported by donor agencies. Access to livelihoods is not a guarantee that durable solutions to displacement will be achieved and that gender gaps will be reduced, as men may wrest control of the livelihood opportunities and gains associated with them. Providing increased incomes for women may not necessarily mean they have full control of the financial gains because the men may still invoke their proprietary rights over the women. As shown in other conflict contexts, men may resent women’s access to resources and may subject women to domestic violence.

Skills trainings for displaced women need to include job opportunities in relevant industries. This can be a problem, however, when there are no industries willing or able to absorb the trainees after they finish. Displaced communities are often in areas where there are limited investment opportunities for private sector groups. There is a need, therefore, to create a demand side to this equation, by encouraging more private sector investments near areas affected by forced migration due to armed conflict.

Creating a demand for trainees among displaced populations could be an innovative approach, as it not only paves the way for gainful employment after training, but it can also set the stage for enhanced confidence building, thus increasing levels of social capital among diverse communities in Mindanao. Investments require high levels of trust among partners. This is not only meaningful but also challenging when investors belong to ethno-linguistic groups that used to have high levels of distrust or prejudice against Muslims or indigenous peoples.

Further in-depth studies are needed on the links between peacebuilding initiatives and poverty reduction, especially in conflict-prone communities. These can inform policy makers and government decision makers alike to enable communities to become more resilient in the face of chronic displacement. Feasibility studies on innovative village-level savings and loans programs need to be explored, especially those schemes that follow Islamic guidelines on investments where both clients and investors share profits and losses equally. More studies on security measures for displaced women and girls are needed, starting with the investigation of sexual harassment and other forms of gender-based violence, and human rights violations of displaced women. These studies should include incidences of human trafficking in displaced communities. A thorough review should be conducted of policies on the recruitment of female workers, especially those coming from vulnerable, displaced communities, with a view to providing stronger social protection for women recruited for dangerous or potentially exploitative work. More thorough gender analyses need to be conducted among displaced communities to accurately determine the varying needs and capacities of displaced men and women.

Economic empowerment programs for women should have built-in guidelines for the protection of women, and local legislation or ordinances should be formulated to institutionalize these guidelines. Based on gender analyses, assistance programs should be appropriately tailored with a view toward reducing gender inequalities in displacement contexts. Donor agencies should insist on the mainstreaming of gender into the entire project cycle as a requirement for accessing funding and project implementation, to ensure that projects address the different needs and capacities of women, men, children and other potentially vulnerable internally displaced persons. IDPs living outside of evacuation centers should be included in databases of displaced communities. A thorough, gender-sensitive assessment of IDPs’ needs and capacities should be conducted in order to enable the design of relevant and sustainable socio-economic programs to help them regain or establish sustainable livelihoods. Local ordinances on the status of displaced persons should be revisited in host communities where IDPs have decided to stay more or less permanently. Ordinances on “informal dwellers” need to be revisited as they are incompatible with the rights of IDPs to free movement, and hinder their abilities to establish sustainable livelihoods.","July 11, 2013",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
50,The ethical algorithm,https://www.brookings.edu/events/the-ethical-algorithm/,N/A,"On January 14, Michael Kearns and Aaron Roth, authors of “The Ethical Algorithm: The Science of Socially Aware Algorithm Design”, joined Brookings scholar Nicol Turner-Lee to discuss the role, limits, and challenges of implementing ethical algorithms.

From education to employment, algorithms are increasingly augmenting human decisionmaking in important sectors. Despite widespread implementation to streamline processes, reduce human prejudice, and cut costs, algorithms are far from neutral. In fact, algorithmic bias can lead to systematically discriminatory outcomes that have significant impacts on people’s lives. Under most circumstances, algorithmic bias is an unintentional side effect of machine learning. Training these algorithms involves the collection and analysis of enormous quantities of historical data that is used to inform decisionmaking and optimization. However, any historical biases embedded in the data can be absorbed and reproduced.

The emerging science of ethical algorithm design seeks to provide mathematical definitions of fairness and privacy and directly code algorithms to correct for existing biases. Because many definitions of fairness and privacy exist, ethical algorithm design takes a preventative approach: researchers first identify harmful algorithmic behaviors, and then design and implement a code that avoids those behaviors.

While ethical algorithms could represent a critical step forward in correcting a flawed feedback loop, technology alone cannot solve difficult social issues. Remedying entrenched social biases and defining concepts such as fairness and privacy sit firmly within the human domain including carefully balancing accuracy and fairness within algorithms.

Bias occurs when errors are disproportionately concentrated in one group, such as an algorithm that rejects employment applications from a minority group at a higher rate than background groups. When this occurs, developers can set a false rejection rate to be equal or fall within a certain percentage margin, meaning that the minority group is rejected at the same or similar rate as background groups.  However, the smaller the margin is, the higher the frequency of error. While fairness would improve the disproportionately affected group, overall accuracy of the data may be reduced. Quantitatively defining an acceptable balance between accuracy and fairness is a critical component in ethical algorithm design, and may differ depending on the application, requiring an iterative process.

In many ways, data privacy can act as a model for ethical algorithm development. Traditional methods of data privacy involve anonymizing data through the removal of certain data points. However, information can be easily de-anonymized by combining multiple sets of data. As an alternative to de-anonymization, Kearns and Roth discussed the concept of “differential privacy,” which adds random noise to datasets to conceal individual pieces of information. This process helps support the confidentiality of individual information, but also leads to questions of accuracy and privacy.

Nearly 15 years since its inception, a wide range of institutions have adopted differential privacy, including the upcoming 2020 U.S. Census. Establishing and encoding a quantitative definition of privacy against other tradeoffs, including the value of the dataset to downstream users (particularly important for census data), sets a useful precedent for ethical algorithm design.

Kearns and Roth call for an ideological shift from controlling algorithmic inputs, to focusing on desired outcomes. For example, omitting race as a variable in lending practices does not always lead to unbiased outcomes, because proxies for race such as zip codes can similarly lead to biased results. In an era of data abundance, simply controlling for inputs is insufficient in addressing discrimination. However, encoding concepts such as fairness and privacy might require complicated tradeoffs that can be difficult to define.

While technology companies and researchers could explore ethical algorithm design to efficiently catch algorithmic bias at its source, regulatory enforcement also plays an important role in ensuring compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws. Currently, technology regulators are ill-equipped to the task of monitoring and auditing technology companies. Kearns and Roth diagnose two main reasons and prescribe potential solutions. First, the resources gap between technology regulators and companies has grown substantially in recent years. To create a level playing field, regulators should increase their in-house technical expertise and capacity. This may involve compositional and organization changes, or the creation of new regulatory agencies.

Next,  technology regulators should pivot away from traditional regulatory methodologies to align more closely with industry realities. For example, regulators have traditionally viewed mergers based on the maturity of the markets and their sector. However, technology companies might see mergers not as a way to branch into a new market, but to access and integrate new consumers, data, and information into one combined entity.

Algorithms represent a technological breakthrough in efficient, accurate, and expedient decisionmaking, but if left unchecked can result in discriminatory outcomes that undermine social values. The lesson of ethical algorithm design is clear: with great algorithmic power comes great human responsibility.","Tuesday, January 14, 2020",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
51,Assessing past and future strategies for reducing poverty in Africa,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/assessing-past-and-future-strategies-for-reducing-poverty-in-africa/,Louise Fox,"When the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were announced in 2015, it was clear that success on SDG1—eradication of extreme poverty—depended on Africa’s performance. Recent forecasts from the United Nations and the World Bank suggest that Africa is not going to make it.

We should all be concerned, but what can be done? The recent World Bank study, Accelerating Poverty Reduction in Africa, offers governments and stakeholders both new suggestions as well as new takes on old recommendations, providing a clear if bumpy road map for future strategies and intervention designs. Despite its length, the report is well worth our time. I have no doubt that it will serve as a key reference volume in the coming years.

Why has poverty in Africa stayed so stubbornly high despite record economic growth? According to the report, three main reasons: (i) less of Africa’s growth translates into poverty reduction because of high initial poverty, including low asset levels and limited access to public services, which prevent households from taking advantage of opportunities; (ii) Africa’s increasing reliance on natural resources for income growth rather than agricultural and rural development excludes the 85 percent of the poor population living in rural areas; and (iii) Africa’s high fertility and resulting high population growth mean that even high growth translates into less income per person—a point too often ignored in discussions on the sub-continent and in Washington.

In addressing these worrying trends, the report singles out four areas for particular attention: (i) reduce fertility; (ii) increase agricultural productivity, especially for food crops (an African green revolution); (iii) address risk and conflict; and (iv) increase domestic resource mobilization and focus resources on the poor. These areas are certainly key for the livelihoods and welfare of the poor, and it is great to see a report that sets a few priorities as opposed to requiring African governments to undertake a laundry list of initiatives at once. While I might have added a fifth—urban governance for poverty reduction—the focus on a few areas combined with an excellent synthesis of vast quantities of new research on what has worked in supporting economic development in Africa is both stimulating and refreshing.

Despite its importance to economic growth and poverty reduction throughout Asia and Latin America, agriculture remains a neglected sector in Africa. The report appropriately highlights this gap and calls for a focus on transforming the livelihoods of small-holder farm households. One reason for current neglect is the failure of many interventions in rural areas. The report clearly and cogently summarizes a large and recent literature on successes and failures of interventions and policies in Africa and elsewhere to argue for a renewed effort. Food crops are still the basis for the badly needed green revolution in Africa because of the large share of food that is imported; the fact that poorer farmers are more likely to produce staple crops; and, that low profit margins discourage the private sector from investing to develop the value chains in this sector the way that they do for vegetables, fruits, or sesame, for example. The report calls for public sector interventions throughout the staples value chain—in research and development, infrastructure, extension and marketing—noting that interventions that only address one constraint (e.g., input quality) often fail as other binding constraints (e.g., lack of rural roads) kick in. While arguing for an integrated approach, operating on multiple constraints throughout the value chain to improving farm livelihoods, the report admits in the chapter conclusion that this is much more difficult to execute and sustain—especially if external donors are in the driver’s seat instead of domestic agencies and institutions. Although I agree with the admission, I found the chapter conclusion less than satisfactory. Is there a middle ground, addressing fewer issues with less complexity that has lower risks yet enough rewards? Also, the report ducked the genetically modified foods (GMO) controversy, even though this technology is the best hope for African agriculture (including staple crops).","October 21, 2019",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
52,What to do if hate comes to your town,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-to-do-if-hate-comes-to-your-town/,Hon. Michael A. Nutter,"Wake up. Pay attention. There’s one major problem with living in the past, or trying to have your own version of facts or history–the past is over, and history has left a record.

We just experienced this in the ugliest, rawest, vicious and frightening terms in Charlottesville with the vehicular homicide of Heather Heyer, and the tragic death of two state troopers, who were flying a helicopter to ensure the safety of all participants. We would be wise to pause and recognize the sanctity of all of their lives.

And so now the question posed long ago by Dr. Martin Luther King is hanging in the air, blowing in these windy times with an acrid and pungent odor: “Where do we go from here: chaos or community?” Sleeping with our eyes wide open, we allowed ourselves to believe that events like this could not happen. In what normally would have been envisioned as a cinematic recreation of the seemingly long ago civil rights era, we saw white people (mostly white men, and young white men in particular) marching down the streets of Charlottesville with fiery tiki torches. My, how times have changed. These individuals seem to be angry and upset about so many things that it’s hard to compile a list. But suffice to say if you are not one of them, look, or think like them, then they’ve likely convinced themselves that you and your family are deserving of hate.

What is a city, a mayor, and a citizenry to do when confronted with this level of hate, offensive speech, and potential violence? I would like to offer some thoughts and suggestions. My experience as mayor, having dealt with some sincerely tense and raw situations, and the rumors of more conflicts over the next weeks and months, lead me to believe that others may be wondering what to do if hate comes to your town.

The local government’s leader must ensure the safety of all of his or her citizens and residents. I strongly believe in the tenets of the First Amendment, especially the freedom of speech and the freedom to assemble. As we know through the bounds of law, there are limits on both. Before any permit is granted to any group seeking to assemble in this explosive environment, ensure that you have a plan in place to ensure the safety of all participants. If you are not confident that you can have a safe event because of the behavior of various participants–simply do not authorize a permit for the event.

Not just from the mayor, but from the clergy,  private sector, civic leaders, and foundations/philanthropic organizations. Those and many other leaders, along with elected officials at all three levels of government should/must come together with a message of peace, unity, and common understanding to send the right messages to the citizenry.

A number of years ago, in a moment of public safety crisis for the city of Philadelphia, we took extraordinary actions to unify the city regarding violence reduction. Numerous convenings took place with the city’s vitally important leaders: the clergy, civic community leaders, business leaders, and the philanthropic community all came together to address this important issue. We asked these diverse leaders to come together, take on specific responsibilities, support our programs, speak to their own constituencies, and talk to the public about the need to rally our citizens around stopping and preventing violence, and protecting our young people and adults. These leadership efforts were a significant part of our overall success in violence reduction.

These issues are now at the top of citizens’ minds, and local leaders have the opportunity to convene serious conversations where residents can share candid views and opinions. These local conversations can be organized with the goal of facilitating real, respectful dialogue for the purpose of achieving a level of healing and reconciliation. More than likely, your city—and certainly this country—needs healing and reconciliation if we are going to get through this very tough period without a new uncivil war of words and destruction.

America, we’re better than this, and our children are watching us right now. Let us all get to work, on behalf of the United States of America. We are still the change we have been waiting for.","August 16, 2017",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
53,"TV ratings for the Women’s World Cup Final were 3 times bigger than the Stanley Cup Final, so why did FIFA give it short shrift?",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tv-ratings-for-the-womens-world-cup-final-were-3-times-bigger-than-the-stanley-cup-final-so-why-did-fifa-give-it-short-shrift/,"Rebecca Campany, Brookings Institution Press","A few weeks ago we kicked off the Women’s World Cup by

sharing an interview with Brookings Press author Andrew Zimbalist

on how FIFA treats the Women’s World Cup differently than the men’s.

Zimbalist’s latest book, “



Circus Maximus



,” delves into the outsized costs of hosting major sporting events and asks the important question: Is it worth it?

We caught up with Zimbalist again after the incredible victory by the U.S. Women’s National Team over Japan to learn more about the game. How many people tuned in? Did Sepp Blatter attend? And why, despite continually strong TV ratings, do teams in the Women’s World Cup play on subpar fields and win less prize money than the men?
To learn more, read the full interview with Zimbalist below.

Zimbalist: The TV ratings have been impressive. The semi-final game between the U.S. and German teams earned a 6.1 rating with 8.4 million viewers in the U.S. In Germany, despite the fact that the match started at 1 am German time, it garnered a 42.6 percent share with an average of 2.63 million viewers.

Yesterday’s final game between the U.S. and Japan earned a 15.2 overnight rating. That handily beats even the previous U.S. record for the single highest-rated soccer game of all time, which was a 13.3 overnight for the Women’s World Cup USA-China final in 1999.

NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman can crow all he wants about the resurgence of hockey’s popularity, but its Stanley Cup final game this year drew only a 5.6 rating. The women’s final even came within a hair of matching the NBA championship game last month between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors which garnered a 15.9 overnight rating.

Zimbalist: While FIFA president Sepp Blatter likes to take full credit for the growth of women’s soccer, by any objective measure FIFA continues to treat the women in a blatantly discriminatory manner. The men play their World Cup on grass. The women wanted to play on grass as well, but were denied. Turf is not only a different game in terms of ball movement, but it entails rubber pellets from the turf flying into the face, hair, and uniforms of the players. Despite the strong TV ratings and attendance of the Women’s World Cup, the prize money for the men’s Cup is 38.5 times higher than it is for the women’s Cup. And just to put an exclamation point on the prejudicial treatment of the women, neither Blatter nor his chief lieutenant, FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke, appeared at any of the Women’s World Cup games. They were both in Brazil for the entirety of the men’s World Cup in 2014.

Zimbalist: Blatter is hanging around long enough to try to influence the selection of his successor. After the previously corrupt FIFA president, Joao Havelange, retired in 1998, Blatter arranged for Havelange to have a handsomely remunerated and perked position as the president emeritus. Blatter would like a similar deal, along with the possibility of playing an eminence gris role. Whether this comes to pass will be a function of how the U.S. and Swiss investigations of FIFA’s corruption play out.

FIFA is a monopoly of the world’s most popular sport. It is subject to no regulatory authority. We shouldn’t expect abuse from FIFA to disappear. The best we can hope for is that it be minimized. To accomplish this FIFA needs to change its voting system for selecting its president, to accept oversight by an independent board of directors, to make the votes of its executive committee on the host country transparent, and to incorporate women equally into its decision-making apparatus.","July 6, 2015",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
54,Dilemmas of the Israeli-Palestinian impasse,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/dilemmas-of-the-israeli-palestinian-impasse/,Natan Sachs,"Once again, Israeli-Palestinian relations are at an impasse. Unlike myriad previous times, however, many on both sides and in the international community are giving up on the possibility of conflict resolution in the near future. Many are even rethinking their basic assumptions about whether and how this conflict might be resolved. Thirty-seven years since Camp David and 22 years since Oslo, seemingly all avenues for progress have been tried: international conferences, bilateral or trilateral negotiations, mediated proximity talks, autonomous Palestinian institution building, and unilateral Israeli withdrawals, all to no avail.

What now then? While some in the State Department still hope to revive direct negotiations for a final status agreement now, President Obama recently stated publicly, in an interview with Ilana Dayan of Israel’s Channel Two, that “I don’t see a likelihood of a framework agreement. I don’t see the likelihood of us being able to emerge from Camp David or some other process and hold up hands.”

This impasse results in a series of policy dilemmas, each presenting a need to balance between short- and long-term goals: preserving the possibility of conflict resolution through partition, likely in a two-state solution, and the dire need to improve conditions in the interim. Should the parties, and the United States, try to steer the ever-shifting status quo toward future resolution, or should they focus on avoiding the resumption of large-scale violence, with its immediate devastation and long-term damage?

Should Israel deal with Hamas, against the wishes of Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, in order to ease conditions in Gaza and stabilize the situation there?

How much deference should the United States and Israel accord Abbas, with the end of his reign looming? How should they prepare for the day after Abbas?

How should the United States deal with the growing Palestinian effort to internationalize the conflict? Should the United States put forward its own plan on the international stage, as the administration has considered?

The source of most recent misery in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains largely unchanged: the stand-off between Hamas, in control of Gaza Strip, and Israel, blockading the Strip. The ideal solution, to my mind, is clear: Hamas would disarm and Israel would lift the blockade. That is very unlikely to happen.

Hamas has wrought tremendous damage to the now-moribund peace process, to Israeli civilians, and most of all to those Palestinians whom it governs and drags to war with a superior power every few years. I find thoroughly unconvincing the suggestions that Hamas may moderate such that it could emerge as a partner for a two-state solution. It belies Hamas’s long track record in the West Bank and especially in Gaza, not to mention Hamas’s own repeated statements of principle. Some in Hamas may of course accept a state within the 1967 borders, but even they don’t claim their demands, or their fight, would stop there.

If there were a responsible way to remove Hamas from power, I would suggest considering it seriously. Unfortunately, given the balance of power in the Strip, the emergence of Salafist elements in Gaza that out-terrorize Hamas, and, most importantly, its solid base of support among a large segment of Palestinians, I do not see a responsible way to do so. Hamas is, of course, not only a militia, but also a political party with political incentives that can be leveraged. It is a dismal reality to be dealt with, but it is not beyond the realm of geopolitics.

This logic now appears finally to have gained traction among the Israeli political leadership. Urged by the military, the political leadership has been easing restrictions on Gaza and is likely ready to ease them further if security arrangements could be found, with active U.N. brokering already underway. A long-shot possibility of an informal Israel-Hamas ceasefire has even emerged. In such a scenario, Hamas would limit its re-arming and the construction of tunnels into Israel’s territory (tunnels that have no conceivable non-military purpose) and Israel would significantly ease the restrictions on the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza.

Indeed, since the conflict in the summer of 2014 there has been a quiet sea change in the Israeli approach to the Gaza Strip, led by security officials. Whereas before the conflict, Israel vociferously rejected a nominal unity government between Fatah and Hamas, Israel now appears to accept, begrudgingly, Hamas’s role, though it is still unlikely to accept a unity government in which Hamas is included. Even hardliner cabinet member Naftali Bennett seems open to this possibility: After criticizing Prime Minister Netanyahu during the last conflict for not bringing down Hamas, Bennett has now argued that Israel should, for the time being, acquiesce to Hamas’s rule and ease economic conditions in the Strip considerably.

Partial Israeli accommodation of Hamas, however, though good for the Palestinians and the Israelis in the interim, would be politically harmful to Abbas. It could be construed by the Palestinian public as a vindication of Hamas’s decision to pursue—and especially to continue—the war in 2014 long after repeated cease-fires had been brokered. The armed struggle would seem to some to have achieved what negotiations could not, as preposterous as this perception would be. (If Hamas had not decided to fight Israel from the evacuated Gaza Strip, there would not have been a blockade or recurrent conflicts to begin with. Note, for example, that by refraining from war, the West Bank has so far avoided much of the misery of Gaza. It was Hamas’s wars, not Fatah’s negotiations, that brought about Gaza’s misery.)

Indeed, even if Israel and Hamas were to go toward a tacit agreement (still a long shot), two actors remain to be convinced: Egypt and Abbas. The former has maintained a hostile posture toward Hamas due to its connection to the Muslim Brotherhood, and has closed off the Gaza Strip tunnels to the Sinai. Now, Egypt finds itself in an intense battle with ISIS-affiliated groups in the Sinai, at Gaza, and Israel’s doorstep. Abbas, perhaps buoyed by Egypt’s stance, has refused since last summer’s conflict to facilitate the reconstruction of Gaza, let alone the opening of the Strip (which would likely require his troops to man the border crossings), an irresponsible position for the nominal president of the residents of Gaza.

The policy dilemma is therefore between short- and medium-term goals: work to avoid a repeat of the summer of 2014 or promote the long-term interests of resolution, which lie with Abbas and perhaps with his successors, not with Hamas.

This is not a simple dilemma. Deal with Hamas, and there could be real long-term damage on other fronts. Avoid Hamas altogether, however, and a repeat of the conflicts of 2008 to 2009, 2012, and 2014 is quite likely. To my mind, the possibility should at least be explored seriously.

Abbas and his regime are critical not only for putative negotiations down the road, but to prevent full-scale violence in the West Bank. Currently, the simmering violence against both Israelis and Palestinians is held at bay not only by the vigilance of the Israeli security forces, but by the close security coordination between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) forces, despite the political impasse.

Indeed, in one incident during the Gaza conflict in the summer of 2014, Fatah militants boasted of firing live ammunition during a demonstration against Israeli soldiers at Qalandia, between Jerusalem and Ramallah. The next day, a Friday and the holiday of Leilat al Qadr during Ramadan, the stage was set for clashes that could bring the fighting from Gaza back to the West Bank, where it had begun. It was the notable discipline of the official PA security forces—many of them Fatah people themselves—that prevented dramatic deterioration by creating a physical buffer between the demonstrators and Israeli troops.

This cooperation comes under considerable (and rather cynical) political fire, since it also benefits Israelis. Such criticism, however, not only discounts the value of Israeli lives, but also those of Palestinians, the weaker party that suffers more from violence. Despite his many shortcomings, Abbas has succeeded in avoiding the devastation of war in the West Bank, something neither his predecessor nor his rivals in the Gaza Strip could claim. The security cooperation has been at the heart of this success.

Abbas now displays neither youth (he is in his 80s), robust health (a heavy smoker), nor the dynamic energy required of a leader in difficult times. He has repeatedly threatened to resign and is committed not to run in the next elections, if and when any are held.

How much deference, therefore, should Abbas receive as Israel and the United States each weigh their policy options? He offers the best hope for avoiding catastrophe in the short-term, but apparently little in the way of a path forward. Fostering relations with potential successors—Abbas has avoided appointing a vice president—also risks alienating Abbas, something the United States in particular has been loath to do.

Abbas is a known and responsible partner for both the United States and Israel, but he is a lame duck in all but actually facing a clear end to his term. The United States and Israel must prepare, with the requisite diplomatic sensitivity, for the day after his presidency.

A focus on the long-term led the Obama administration to adopt the Palestinian opposition to interim arrangements of any kind. If interim arrangements are reached with no final status agreement in sight, Palestinians have argued, such arrangements would only become permanent.

Since Ehud Barak set out to Camp David in 2000, he and others in Israel have argued that Israel should not wait for a partner for full peace—which many Israelis believe is absent—but rather take matters into its own hand and draw provisional borders. The Quartet Roadmap for Peace, led by the United States, indeed envisioned a Palestinian state with provisional borders. Sharon’s unilateral “disengagement” from Gaza and the northern West Bank a decade ago was, for some like then-Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, the start of a broader move to disengage from significantly more of the West Bank as well.

An incremental approach could offer tangible benefits to both sides, easing conditions on the ground and allowing for further Palestinian contiguity and economic development. It has severe drawbacks as well. If done unilaterally, interim steps can greatly diminish the standing of Israel’s putative partners for future peace and embolden Hamas, which would argue, again, that its violence had driven Israel out. Military redeployment could allow Hamas or even more violent groups to take over, as in Gaza. Indeed, more than any other incident, Israelis cite the Gaza disengagement as proof in the futility of concessions to the Palestinians.

To my mind, however, with no other way forward, the notion that nothing should be done in the interim for fear of losing the (absent) way forward, is misguided. Interim steps, including evacuation of remote settlements, need not entail military redeployment nor must they be unilateral, provided a Palestinian leadership were willing to coordinate. They could allow for a tangible easing of conditions and a change of momentum away from deepening conflict.

The business of real peace in fact often involves imperfect, partial steps. To be sure, such interim steps must not prejudice the broader goal of peace down the road—a policy consideration that considerably limits the menu of interim steps. Interim steps should not provide cover for moves by either side that will further close the window on conflict resolution. But it is worth remembering that the alternative to interim steps—the current course—hardly fairs better by this measure.

The impasse in Israeli-Palestinian relations has led the Palestinians and others to the last arena where they are strongest—the international one. There have been several initiatives to introduce Palestine as a member state of international bodies such as the United Nations or to set timelines for the (woefully un-derspecified) “end of occupation.” These have been accompanied by a growing public push to boycott, divest, or sanction not just the Israeli presence in the West Bank, but also Israel itself, Israeli individuals, or, when bigotry is most apparent, non-Israeli Jews.

The problem is, of course, that ending occupation is not as simple, nor as well-defined, as it sounds. Ask the peace mediators that tried to resolve the conflict over the past two decades and more. Occupation is surely unjust, but it is not nearly the sum of the conflict nor would ending it end Palestinian claims. Justice always seems simple to either side; peace, alas, is not.

The main policy dilemma for the United States has been whether to preempt some of these initiatives and publicly outline the framework agreement arrived at by the U.S. negotiating team in 2014, as the president and the secretary of state have contemplated. Such a public framework—as a Security Council resolution or a presidential statement—would have the benefit of capitalizing on the work done by this administration and serving a policy focal point going forward. It might help cement the idea of a two-state solution and stave off some of the more pernicious alternative ideas out there.

Neither side would likely endorse a detailed framework however. It would necessarily include language—especially on Jerusalem—that this Israeli government would never agree to and that no Israeli government would agree to outside the context of a full, mutually-accepted accord. Similarly, the Palestinians are sure to object to much of the framework (Abbas, after all, never replied to the framework agreement presented to him), especially on a return of Palestinian refugees and descendants or on ideational reconciliation (the Israeli demand that they accept Israel as a—underspecified—Jewish nation state.)

In other words, publishing a framework for a two-state solution before Obama leaves office could offer a basis for long-term gains in future conflict resolution. Doing so, however, would also increase the possibility of the short-term danger of each side painting itself further into its corner on the very issues the framework hopes to resolve.

During the years of the active peace process, balancing long-term and short-term goals could appear relatively simple: avoid catastrophe just long enough for a final status agreement to be reached. In the current impasse, a deal does not look likely any time soon. Accordingly, the main policy challenge now, in my view, is balancing two different goals: active conflict management, with modest goals, and keeping the door open to conflict resolution in the future.

In the four policy dilemmas noted above, efforts should now be made to avoid the worst outcomes—widespread violence in particular—and to normalize the situation, without excessive concern for the chances of immediate resumption of negotiations. Thus, Israel and the United States should vigorously explore a modus vivendi in Gaza, despite Abbas’s objections, while working to persuade him to live up to his responsibilities as president in Gaza. He, not Hamas, should receive as much credit as possible for the benefits of such an arrangement, but he should not be allowed to prevent one for fear of the responsibilities it would entail.

Further, the Palestinians themselves will have to choose their next leader, but it is high time to face the reality that that day is not far; Abbas will not likely be the first president of an independent Palestine. Policymakers would do well to prepare for that day, and put less stock in—and pay less deference too—Abbas the man.

Managing the interim also means that any steps that can normalize the situation—including physical Israeli redeployment or transfer of authority to the PA in parts of the West bank—should be encouraged, provided they do not prejudice the long-term goal of partition. The interim is likely to last a while regardless of present policy; it should be made as manageable as possible.

Finally, while publishing a U.S. framework agreement now is likely to meet stiff resistance from both parties, the damage will likely dissipate long before serious negotiations are resumed. Key principles could therefore be set forth as useful long-term goals to which all parties can, in time, recommit, and with which all short-term steps should be made commensurate.","September 17, 2015",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
55,The Return of Refugees and IDPs and Sustainable Peace,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-return-of-refugees-and-idps-and-sustainable-peace/,Khalid Koser,"In this brief presentation I’d like to cover five main topics. First I’ll say a few words about the main differences between refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), as I’ve been asked to cover both in my talk. Second I’ll provide a quick overview of contemporary dimensions and dynamics of displacement and return. Third I’d like to explain why durable solutions for the displaced are often inextricably linked to achieving sustainable peace in post-conflict settings. Fourth I’ll outline some of the key challenges confronting returnees and policies for overcoming them. Finally I’ll indicate where I think the main responsibilities lie in supporting durable solutions and building peace, with a particular focus on the role of the UN Peacebuilding Commission.

Rather than talk at length about the definition on one hand of a refugee and on the other of an IDP, I thought instead it would be useful simply to highlight some of the critical differences between the two categories. One critical difference concerns the causes for flight for each category. As stipulated in the 1951 Convention in Refugees, refugees are essentially defined as people fleeing the threat of persecution. According to the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, in contrast, IDPs flee not just persecution and conflict, but also natural and man-made disasters and the effects of the development projects. The IDP definition is therefore much wider than the refugee definition. Another fundamental difference is that refugees have crossed internationally-recognized state borders, whereas IDPs have not. Furthermore whereas the refugee definition is a legal category, laid down in an international convention, the IDP definition is descriptive – it has no legal standing.

For the purposes of this presentation, one of the most important implications of these differences is that it can be far harder to discern when displacement comes to an end for IDPs than for refugees. It is fairly easy to say when refugees stop being refugees – either they can cross back over an international border to their country of origin, or their legal status can be rescinded, or their status can be transferred to another status, such as citizen. But IDPs have not crossed a border, have no legal status, and are already citizens of the country where they are displaced.

There are around 10 million refugees worldwide. Their numbers have increased slightly in recent years, but the total nevertheless represents a significant reduction from just a decade ago. Significant refugee repatriations in recent years have taken place from Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Guinea, Congo and Uganda. There are about 24 million IDPs worldwide, and this number is only for those displaced by the effects of conflict. There have been significant returns in recent years in Sudan, Lebanon, DRC, Uganda and Israel.

Resolving displacement is often inextricably linked with achieving sustainable peace, for a number of reasons: Most fundamentally, IDPs and returning refugees – like all other war-affected civilians – have rights grounded in international human rights law and international humanitarian law, and states have an obligation to protect those rights. Numbers also matter: In one quarter of the countries currently in conflict, over five percent of the population is internally displaced. There are over one million IDPs in Colombia, the DRC, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda. In countries such as these the sheer scale of displacement makes it simply unrealistic to plan for the peaceful future of the country without incorporating the needs of the displaced and ensuring their active participation.

Helping displaced populations to return and reintegrate can simultaneously address the root causes of a conflict and help prevent further displacement. For example, the return of displaced populations can be an important signifier of peace and the end of conflict, and can play an important part in validating the post-conflict political order. The return of displaced populations can be a pre-condition for peace if they are politically active. And the return of displaced populations can make an important contribution to the recovery of local economies. In some countries, furthermore, IDPs and refugees have become parties to the conflict, and their inclusion is therefore necessary for conflict-resolution.

Including displaced populations at an early stage in a peace processes can initiate momentum for them to be active participants in post-conflict peace-building. More widely, broad-based civil society participation in political processes – including peace – is increasingly seen as good practice. A variety of UN and other international conventions and agreements recognizes the rights of children, youth and women to participate in political processes that affect their lives.

Creating or maintaining an environment that is safe enough for displaced persons to return to their homes and places of origin is an important task of peace-building efforts. In many countries coming out of an armed conflict, landmines and unexploded ordnance pose a significant obstacle to the safety of returnees, to reconstruction efforts and to the development of economic activities. The presence of armed groups may create a serious obstacle to return and may be considered as a threat by potential returnees. Where impunity prevails, durable solutions for displaced persons are not possible and such impunity may create new tensions. Often, the safety of displaced persons and returnees can be threatened by criminal elements among the local population or by returning combatants who have been demobilized but have not successfully reintegrated into civilian life. In this case, return will not take place or will not be sustainable without the presence of law enforcement agencies in areas of return.

Tensions between local communities and displaced persons are often related to disputes over resources and property. Lack of reconstruction of destroyed houses or non-return of property left behind – taken over by either the local population or persons who themselves have been displaced – create serious obstacles to return. Female heads of household, orphans or unaccompanied children may face particular problems recovering property. The situation of certain minorities or indigenous peoples can be especially problematic, especially when they were holding traditional but informal titles not recognized by the authorities. The judiciary may be overburdened or otherwise unable to solve property disputes.

The following measures may contribute to reducing property disputes and thus stabilizing peace: Registering land left behind by displaced persons and updating or creating land registries; taking appropriate legal measures to recognize property rights of women and orphans; formalizing informal forms of property traditionally held by minorities or other vulnerable groups and restoring collective forms of property to indigenous peoples; establishing administrative mechanisms to handle large numbers of property disputes or to provide compensation for damage; establishing efficient law enforcement mechanisms to enforce orders to vacate and restore to its lawful owner property belonging to displaced persons and returnees; and developing transparent and equitable alternatives if the restitution of property involves the eviction of other displaced persons.

In certain situations, displaced persons cannot return to their places of origin and homes or their return is not sustainable because they are not welcomed by local communities and encounter discrimination or even acts of violence. Inter-communal and intra-communal tensions over access to land and water may further exacerbate IDPs’ and returnees’ fear for their physical safety and lead to further outbreaks of violent clashes. Robust steps aimed at reconciling communities and restoring justice should be considered. Mechanisms of reconciliation and transitional justice should be without prejudice to displaced persons’ rights to restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, reparation and guarantees of non-repetition.

In many post-conflict situations the creation of adequate economic, social and political conditions to make return for displaced persons sustainable remains a huge challenge. When there are not any schools or even the most basic health services, people will prefer to remain in the areas to which they fled. Where basic infrastructure such as water, roads or electricity is destroyed, economic activities may be impossible. Limited access to employment and other forms of livelihood is another major factor deterring people from returning; pre-displacement patterns of discrimination based on ethnicity, political affiliation and gender add to the difficulties returnees face in accessing already strained labor markets. The absence of or high interest rates for micro-credit and bank loans make it difficult to restart businesses or to bridge the time until agricultural land is productive again. In order to make return sustainable and thus to stabilize the situation, it is important to closely coordinate and combine humanitarian assistance for returnees with recovery and development efforts from the outset, instead of planning these activities as consecutive phases.

The process of peace-building requires the establishment of a functioning legitimate government, which usually involves setting up a transitional administration, referenda on a constitution, elections, and activities to ensure that the context in which elections take place is conducive to full participation of the population. In post-conflict situations, political participation can effectively contribute to peace, recovery and long-term development. Thus, taking seriously political rights, including the right to vote and take part in elections and referenda, is highly relevant to societies trying to emerge from conflict and build a more stable and prosperous future. Protecting the civil and political rights of displaced people – the right to vote, to freedom of assembly and association, and of expression – allows displaced persons to play an active role in shaping their own future and that of their nation.

The principal responsibility for providing security; addressing property issues; promoting reconciliation and transitional justice; reconstruction; and political transition – indeed for implementing and monitoring peace-building as a whole – lies clearly with national governments. Governments have obligations under international human rights law and international humanitarian law to protect the rights of all citizens – including IDPs and returning refugees. Some of the critical roles national governments can play in this regard include: establishing the rule of law; developing legal and security institutions; supporting civil society; attracting private sector investment and establishing National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs).

NHRIs have multiple roles that can contribute to protecting IDPs in post-conflict situations: they contribute to the formulation of policy; review legislation to ensure that it is in line with international human rights standards; assist victims in seeking legal redress; and contribute to the development of human rights jurisprudence. Their activities are also often geared towards ensuring compliance with international norms and rules; developing national action plans for human rights protection; investigating complaints; referring human rights cases to courts; participating in legal proceedings; and reporting on human rights issues. Peace agreements in Afghanistan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, El Salvador, Guatemala, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa and Sudan have all included recommendations on the establishment of NHRIs, although in many cases they have not had sufficient capacity to function effectively, and IDPs are rarely explicitly part of their mandate.

The international community – mainly in the form of the UN – has often been criticized for its heavy-handed approach to peace-building, and in particular for its failure to engage with and encourage the role of national governments and local civil society. As a result a more nuanced understanding of the role of the international community has emerged. It has been suggested, for example, that functions that it is appropriate for the international community to fulfill are as an enforcer of existing agreements and resolutions; as a monitor of the implementation of existing agreements; as a mediator and broker between different parties; and as a guarantor. At the same time many UN agencies also continue to fulfill more operational functions in post-conflict contexts.

Increasingly certain peace-making, humanitarian and peace-building tasks are being delegated by states and intergovernmental organizations to NGOs and other civil society actors. Former UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali recognized the assistance that NGOs and civil society can provide for UN peacebuilding efforts, although he equally stressed that ‘…governments are central…’ to peace-building. In other words civil society is seen as complementing – not replacing – the activities of national governments and the international community.

NGOs have comparative advantages over other actors in the peace-building process which make them potentially a particular significant actor for mainstreaming internal displacement issues. They tend to have an unrivalled familiarity with local conflict environments and close contacts with grassroots movements. They are often in a unique position to gather information pertaining to human rights abuses. They tend to have the flexibility, expertise, rapid responses and commitments at the local level to respond to emerging signs of trouble. Through transnational networks they can also provide a link between local level populations and global civil society.

The Peacebuilding Commission is just one component of the international community, which is in itself just one part of a range of actors involved in peace-building. Furthermore, over one year after it began its work, the Peacebuilding Commission has been criticized: for having a limited country focus, for being led by the agenda of national authorities, and for having quickly become politicized.

Nevertheless, the Peacebuilding Commission represents a unique institutional opportunity to mainstream IDPs and returning refugees and their priorities in peace-building efforts worldwide. First, the mandate of the Peacebuilding Commission is broadly to support the development of integrated strategies for post-conflict peace-building. Second, with representatives from the major UN charter bodies the Peacebuilding Commission reflects a broad and representative UN constituency. Additional members include representatives from the main troop-contributing nations and the major funders of peace operations. The inclusion of all major actors with a stake in the success peace-building gives the Peacebuilding Commission significant legitimacy. Third, despite its lack of direct operational capacity, the Commission is tasked with providing recommendations and information to improve the coordination of all relevant actors within and outside the UN. It is therefore in a position to become an important advocate, catalyst, forum and monitor for ensuring that the UN system addresses the needs of displaced persons in the broader context of peace-building.","February 10, 2008",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
56,"Black Progress: How far we’ve come, and how far we have to go",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/black-progress-how-far-weve-come-and-how-far-we-have-to-go/,"Abigail Thernstrom, Stephan Thernstrom","60 and 2.2.
In 1940, 60 percent of employed black women worked as domestic servants; today the number is down to 2.2 percent, while 60 percent hold white- collar jobs.

44 and 1. In 1958, 44 percent of whites said they would move if a black family became their next door neighbor; today the figure is 1 percent.

18 and 86. In 1964, the year the great Civil Rights Act was passed, only 18 percent of whites claimed to have a friend who was black; today 86 percent say they do, while 87 percent of blacks assert they have white friends.

Progress is the largely suppressed story of race and race relations over the past half-century. And thus it’s news that more than 40 percent of African Americans now consider themselves members of the middle class. Forty-two percent own their own homes, a figure that rises to 75 percent if we look just at black married couples. Black two-parent families earn only 13 percent less than those who are white. Almost a third of the black population lives in suburbia.

Because these are facts the media seldom report, the black underclass continues to define black America in the view of much of the public. Many assume blacks live in ghettos, often in high-rise public housing projects. Crime and the welfare check are seen as their main source of income. The stereotype crosses racial lines. Blacks are even more prone than whites to exaggerate the extent to which African Americans are trapped in inner-city poverty. In a 1991 Gallup poll, about one-fifth of all whites, but almost half of black respondents, said that at least three out of four African Americans were impoverished urban residents. And yet, in reality, blacks who consider themselves to be middle class outnumber those with incomes below the poverty line by a wide margin.

Fifty years ago most blacks were indeed trapped in poverty, although they did not reside in inner cities. When Gunnar Myrdal published An American Dilemma in 1944, most blacks lived in the South and on the land as laborers and sharecroppers. (Only one in eight owned the land on which he worked.) A trivial 5 percent of black men nationally were engaged in nonmanual, white-collar work of any kind; the vast majority held ill-paid, insecure, manual jobs—jobs that few whites would take. As already noted, six out of ten African-American women were household servants who, driven by economic desperation, often worked 12-hour days for pathetically low wages. Segregation in the South and discrimination in the North did create a sheltered market for some black businesses (funeral homes, beauty parlors, and the like) that served a black community barred from patronizing “white” establishments. But the number was minuscule.","March 1, 1998",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
57,Understanding Urban Riots in France,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/understanding-urban-riots-in-france/,"Jonathan Laurence, Justin Vaïsse","When Theo Van Ghogh was murdered in Amsterdam on November 2, 2004 by Mohammed Bouyeri, an Islamist with Dutch and Moroccan citizenships, many said that this was the failure of the Dutch model of integration by tolerance. When bombs planted by young Britons of Pakistani and Jamaican descent exploded in the London subway on July 7, 2005, many said that this signified the failure of the British model of integration by multiculturalism. A month and a half later, when levees broke in New Orleans under the onslaught of hurricane Katrina and the poor, predominantly black population was trapped in the flooded city, many said that this revealed the failure of the integrating power of the “American dream.” And when riots erupted on the outskirts of major French cities (though not in Marseille, as will be seen later) in November 2005, many said that this unmasked the weakness of the French “one-law-for-all” republican model of integration.

Now, that all major models of integration are proclaimed dead, serious analysis may finally begin, because these models often hide as much as they reveal.

For example, in spite of the alleged rigidity of the “republican” model, supposed to prevent French officials from implementing any specific policies directed at immigrant populations, France has actually experimented with policies close to affirmative action. Without recognizing ethnic or religious minorities as such, ambitious social programs have been implemented in urban areas where immigrants live. Those programs, initiated in the early 1980s, included the creations of Zones of Educational Priority, known as ZEPs (Zones d’Education Prioritaire), and special tax-exempt zones (zones franches) meant to stimulate local economic activity. Those programs did in fact bring some—albeit insufficient—results. A lot of public money has been spent on rehabilitating bleak housing projects in immigrant neighborhoods under the guise of “urban policy” (politique de la ville), which could be more aptly called “suburban” (banlieues) policy. The French military has initiated several recruiting programs aimed at the young from the banlieues. Private firms and even grandes écoles (major universities), like Sciences-Po in Paris, have been reaching out to the minorities in order to diversify their workforce and student bodies.

In other words, the real problem was not the French “republican” model, which has been hailed by many immigrants and which is more flexible than generally admitted, but insufficient mobilization of the French people to make it a reality. The rioting expresses, among other things, frustration caused by the gap between the model and the reality, and a desire to see the fulfillment of the promises inherent in the model. In any case, it is difficult to imagine how the adoption of the “multicultural” model, where minorities are treated as groups endowed with separate collective “identities” and special rights, would suddenly cure such social ills as everyday discriminations, unemployment and ghettoization, which lie at the heart of the current crisis. It is worth remembering that the evolution of the “multicultural” model in the Netherlands and in Great Britain has raised some serious issues, especially after recent terrorist attacks in London. “We have allowed tolerance of diversity to harden into the effective isolation of communities,” said Trevor Phillips, the black British chairman of Great Britain’s Committee for Racial Equality. “We have made too much room for the expression of minorities’ historical identity to the detriment of their loyalty to the United Kingdom today.”i

To get a better idea of the causes of the November 2005 urban riots in France, which have claimed 200 million euros in damaged property and one death, one should try to forget about theoretical models and concentrate on specific factors that caused the eruption at this specific moment and in these specific places. Those factors includethe particular French ethnic context, economic conditions, discrimination, police violence, housing, and (bad) national policies. It should also be clear that despite the claims of many foreign commentators, religion was conspicuously absent from the mix.

Unlike its many European neighbors, France has always been a country of immigrants and has absorbed numerous waves of foreigners. In 1999 no less than 23 percent of the French population claimed foreign origin (with at least one parent or grand-parent coming from abroad). Within this group 5 percent had their roots in the sub-Saharan Africa, 22 percent in the Maghreb, and 2.4 percent in Turkey. Together, those groups represented about 30 percent of French residents of foreign descent—between 4 and 5 million people. In religious terms, today’s France has the largest Muslim and Jewish minorities in the whole Europe.

This means that the challenges of integration are much greater in France than in other European countries, especially because most immigrant workers, who arrived in the 1960s and 1970s, and their families, who joined them between the 1970s and the present, come from rural areas and had little no or education. That does not mean that their are not being integrated into the French mainstream, but their integration is certainly slower and more challenging (and success stories, which are more and more frequent, generally go unreported). For example, children of immigrants do as well at school as French children from the same socio-economic group. However, since immigrants constitute a disproportionately high percentage of the lower classes, in absolute terms their children do less well than children from French families.

The French integration system from the 19th untill the 20th century rested on three pillars: school, compulsory military service, and work. French public schools in the banlieues, despite difficult conditions, are for the most part still fulfilling this task. But general military draft was abolished in the late 1990s, and the economic slow-down that started in 1973 made jobs for the new arrivals increasingly scarce. The young men and teenagers from the banlieues are rioting and burning cars largely because they have little hope of upward social mobility. Among the young men of the cités (largely immigrant housing projects in the suburbs) is as high as 40 percent.

Slow growth rate at the national level is not the only cause of unemployment among these young men—and President Jacques Chirac acknowledged as much in his November 14 speechii. Racism and discrimination are very much alive in the French society, whether in housing, in the job market, or in social life. Young men of North African origin are more likely to be unemployed than their French contemporaries with similar job trainingiii. Negative racial stereotypes lingering from the colonial or even earlier times make everyday life of persons of African origin often difficult and frustrating. The young “Beurs” (a slang word for Arabs) and “Blacks” from the cités report many cases of discrimination, such as being refused entrance to nightclubs.

Of course, such acts are illegal and they are combated by a new government agency called HALDE (Haute Autorité de Lutte contre les Discriminations et pour l’Egalité) with the authority to monitor and fight instances of discrimination. But less obvious forms of racial prejudice persist, and young Frenchmen of Arab origin often believe they should change their names and appearance in order to be considered fully French. The experience of exclusion and unfairness was high on the list of factors that have driven their revolt—sometimes with tacit approval of their fathers and older brothers.

Police violence and racial profiling.Among various types of discrimination suffered by the young from the banlieues one in particular stands out: racial profiling by the police. The riots started when Ziad Benna and Bouna Traore, two teenagers of Tunisian and Malian origin at Clichy-sous-Bois, died in a power substation where they were hiding from the police. Of course, the police in these neighborhoods is working under arduous conditions, but its record has been far from exemplary. Racial profiling is ubiquitous, and even older inhabitants of the cités complain about various affronts they suffer at the hand of the police.

Even worse, due to political changes introduced in 2002 by the Minister of the Interior Nicolas Sarkozy, the previous government’s policies of a friendlier mode of police work, police de proximité (neighborhood policing), were scrapped. As a result, policemen go into the cités only to do the “repressive” part of their job—to impose order, investigate a crime or perform an arrest, which strains their relations with idle and disgruntled teenagers.

An aggravating factor in the life of French ethnic communities is their de facto ghettoization. Strangely enough, an important role is played by the architecture of the cités. Between the mid-1950s and the 1960s a severe housing crisis hit France. The authorities responded with a rush construction program. They built clusters of high-rise apartment houses of ten stories or more that at the time passed for the quintessence of architectural modernity. In addition, they could be built cheaply and quickly enough to provide new, permanent living quarters for the inhabitants of slums that had developed around some cities. But this seeming housing remedy soon turned into a social disaster. The bleak, unglamorous concrete-slab neighborhoods were gradually abandoned by those who could afford to leave: first, by the French blue collars and later, by more successful immigrants.

The populations that stayed behind consisted mostly of the underclass, or “losers”, creating zones of highly concentrated social pathology: school underperformance, unemployment, drug trafficking and other crime, etc. For a teenager, whatever his or her origin, to live in those pockets of poverty is a curse and a social stigma. At the same time a protective, highly territorial cité sub-culture has developed: either you belong here, it is your place and people respect you, or you are a strangers and you better keep out. That includes, of course, the police. In general, cité youngsters rarely venture far from their familiar turf. That is why rioting hardly ever spread to downtown areas, where the young people feel out of place and vulnerable.

With high unemployment, the cités are also zones of profound boredom. There is literally nothing to do there, especially when local associations and community programs are severely underfunded. No wonder that teenagers are having a great time playing Cowboys and Indians with the cops.It is like real-life Game Boy, and the media pay attention!

In other European countries similar phenomena did not develop: there are “tough” neighborhoods, but not quite as bleak as cités that seem to distill social ills, hopelessness and despair to the point of encouraging self-destructive behavior (teenagers were sometimes burning schools and sports facilities they were using themselves). The French authorities are gradually demolishing cités and replacing them with more human-scale housing projects, but the scope and the cost of this endeavor is immense, and it is going on too slowly.

Why did the riots erupt in November 2005 and not three or six or nine years before? Evidently, we are dealing with a cumulative effect, but there is more to it. After the elections of 2002 the new Jean-Pierre Raffarin government embarked on a more conservative policy and de-emphasized social programs. The so-called neighborhood policing was abandoned. Instead, Minister Sarkozy instructed the police to concentrate on providing public safety and combating crime, and not on “social work.” The Raffarin government also severely cut subsidies for community associations and local social workers despite the fact that many sociologists stressed their importance in creating a better social climate and a more nurturing environment for teenagers.

A good way to see the importance of maintaining the “social fabric” is to study the case of Marseille. Despite a large immigrant population, especially from the Maghreb (and the Comoros), and the existence of bleak cités (the quartiers Nord or “Northern quarters” as they are known in Marseille), there was very little unrest. Though no systematic comparative studies have been conducted yet, most experts say that Marseille’s relative stability results from its established social networks, smaller ethnic and economic differences between the rich downtown and the suburbs, the work performed by the community (social workers, mediators, associations, etc.), and better relations between the police and the population.

Last but not least, the one factor that was conspicuously absent was Islam. Reading some conservative American commentators one could get the impression that Paris had been overrun by hordes of radical Islamists. For example, Daniel Pipes writes in The New York Sun,iv about “the first instance of a semi-organized Muslim insurgency in Europe” and about “rioting by Muslim youth that began October 27 in France to calls of ‘Allahu Akbar’.”

Of course, many of the perpetrators of recent violence come from Muslim backgrounds—as do many of their victims. But they have no religious agenda and, even more tellingly, no political agenda: most of them are teenagers, often deprived of hopes for a good future and a good job. Many have already had their brushes with the law. Those youngsters are not likely to listen to anybody: neither to their parents, nor social workers, nor even the soccer star Zinedine Zidane, and least of all to religious authorities.

Both radical Muslim organizations, such as the Tabligh, an international proselytizing group active in France, and more moderate ones, like the Union of French Islamic Organizations (UOIF), which issued a fatwa v condemning the riots as un-Islamic, have revealed their powerlessness and total lack of impact on the situation. Teenagers from the cités are having an exhilarating time and are not going to stop because of an order of an imam or an Islamist recruiter who wants them to lead a boring, pious life. The only real Islamist danger would be to send them to prison where they could encounter religious radicalism.

There have been problems with religious radicalism in the banlieues and among disaffected young French of Muslim background, but they are largely separate from the rioting and rampaging of November 2005. The teenagers that were burning cars were not the ones who cared for religion—even religion suffused with anti-French or anti-Western ideology. It is sad that French Muslims, who as a group had nothing to do with the riots and who according to a recent reportvi feel more and more at home in France, and are even more optimistic about France’s future than other religious groupsvii, may end up paying a disproportionate part of the bill in the form of increased suspicion from their compatriots and from the international community.","December 1, 2005",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
58,Trump and racism: What do the data say?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trump-and-racism-what-do-the-data-say/,"Vanessa Williamson, Isabella Gelfand","The Brookings Cafeteria podcast last week discussed the role President Trump’s racist rhetoric has played in encouraging violence in America. Predictably, some podcast listeners responded skeptically on Twitter, doubting the association between Trump and hateful behavior. It would be naïve to think that data will change many individuals’ minds on this topic, but nonetheless, there is substantial evidence that Trump has encouraged racism and benefitted politically from it.

First, Donald Trump’s support in the 2016 campaign was clearly driven by racism, sexism, and xenophobia. While some observers have explained Trump’s success as a result of economic anxiety, the data demonstrate that anti-immigrant sentiment, racism, and sexism are much more strongly related to support for Trump. Trump’s much-discussed vote advantage with non-college-educated whites is misleading; when accounting for racism and sexism, the education gap among whites in the 2016 election returns to the typical levels of previous elections since 2000. Trump did not do especially well with non-college-educated whites, compared to other Republicans. He did especially well with white people who express sexist views about women and who deny racism exists.

Even more alarmingly, there is a clear correlation between Trump campaign events and incidents of prejudiced violence. FBI data show that since Trump’s election there has been an anomalous spike in hate crimes concentrated in counties where Trump won by larger margins. It was the second-largest uptick in hate crimes in the 25 years for which data are available, second only to the spike after September 11, 2001. Though hate crimes are typically most frequent in the summer, in 2016 they peaked in the fourth quarter (October-December). This new, higher rate of hate crimes continued throughout 2017.

The association between Trump and hate crimes is not limited to the election itself. Another study, based on data collected by the Anti-Defamation League, shows that counties that hosted a Trump campaign rally in 2016 saw hate crime rates more than double compared to similar counties that did not host a rally.

The data analysis discussed above has centered on correlations; they are suggestive of a link between Trump and racist attitudes and behavior, but do not actually demonstrate that one leads to the other. However, there is also causal evidence to point to. In experiments, being exposed to Trump’s rhetoric actually increases expressions of prejudice. In a 2017 survey, researchers randomly exposed some respondents to racist comments by the president, such as:

“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re sending people that have lots of problems… They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”

Other respondents were exposed to a statement by Hillary Clinton condemning prejudiced Trump supporters. Later in the study, the respondents were asked their opinion of various groups, including Mexican people, black people, and young people. Those who had read Trump’s words were more likely to write derogatory things not only about Mexican people, but also about other groups as well.  By contrast, those who were exposed to Clinton’s words were less likely to express offensive views towards Muslims. Words do matter, and data prove it.

Unfortunately, there is little reason to expect this research to have much impact on public attitudes; increasingly, partisanship skews what Americans think qualifies as racist. But there is no excuse for avoiding clear, accurate descriptions of American political dynamics. When the data show that President Trump’s support stems from racist and sexist beliefs, and that his election emboldened Americans to engage in racist behavior, it is the responsibility of social scientists and other political observers to say so.","August 14, 2019",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
59,School dress and grooming codes are the new ‘whites only’ signs,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/school-dress-and-grooming-codes-are-the-new-whites-only-signs/,Andre M. Perry,"Ever since enslaved Black people arrived on the shores of the English colony of Virginia in 1619, white legislators at various levels of government have designed laws to explicitly control and suppress Black communities. In 1857, in its Dred Scott decision, the Supreme Court decided that Black people were not citizens and did not have the right to sue in federal court. Our bondage continued even after the abolition of slavery in 1865: Southern states legislated “Black Codes” immediately after the Civil War, denying Black people the right to vote and restricting their movement. In some municipalities, called “sundown towns,” Black individuals were not allowed to enter after dark. “Whites only” signs littered public spaces throughout the 20th century. It was illegal in so many ways for Black people to simply be in a country supposedly built on the unalienable, natural rights of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”

When racism is the overarching, unwritten law of the land, any and every rule can and will be used to control Black people. Those who would have us return to a period of legal segregation don’t need to bring back signposts to separate us when they can discriminate in other ways, simply on the basis of how we look, how we dress, and how we wear our hair. When dress and grooming codes reinforce white norms, being Black becomes a violation.

In December 2019, Barbers Hill Independent School District in Mont Belvieu, Texas, a suburb east of Houston, decided to begin enforcing a dress code policy that’s been on the books for 30 years. The policy includes sections on clothing, head coverings, and hair: “Male students’ hair will not extend, at any time, below the eyebrows, or below the ear lobes. Male students’ hair must not extend below the top of a t-shirt collar or be gathered or worn in a style that would allow the hair to extend below the top of a t-shirt collar, below the eyebrows, or below the ear lobes when let down.”

DeAndre Arnold has attended the Barbers Hill Independent School District his entire life; in high school, he grew his hair into locks. However, before winter break, the principal of Barbers Hill High School placed DeAndre, a senior, in in-school suspension and told him that he would not be able to attend classes, prom, or even his graduation. Why? Because his dreadlocks violated the dress code. To notify DeAndre months before graduation that he was being suspended for his hair doesn’t make much sense, but racism isn’t logical.

The school district has 5,379 students, of which roughly 70% are white, more than a fifth are Hispanic, just 3% are Black, and nearly 4% come from another racial background. The communities that feed in to Mont Belvieu—Old River-Winfree, Cove, and Beach City—are all around 90% white, according to the latest census data.

“DeAndre (and) his family should not have to go through this. But I expect it from a board that has zero diversity,” Gerry Monroe, a representative of the community activism organization the United Urban Alumni Association, told the school board at a recent meeting.

Clearly, representation matters. Research has shown that diverse decision-making bodies are better problem-solvers than homogenous ones. The lived experience of Black folk shows that all-white decision-making bodies enforce racial biases and stereotypes. Having a racially diverse board would protect against the racist enforcement of dress codes such as Barbers’. Though we do not know the racial composition of the district’s board for sure, their decision to suspend DeAndre lays bare their desire to control Black bodies.

In response to news stories about the school’s decision to suspend DeAndre, the Barbers Hill superintendent tweeted that it’s important to hold Black students to high expectations, implying that dreadlocks are linked to bad performance. Except hair has nothing to do with academic standards or college readiness. The frivolous use of this dress code to prevent students from graduating is about exerting authority over and controlling Black people. Black people should not, cannot change themselves to fit white norms.

The laws have changed, and segregation-era poster boards and signs have evolved; today, people create dress codes that discriminate against Black students’ natural hair. In March 2018, Tenaya Middle School officials in Fresno, California, pulled a 14-year-old male student out of class for a haircut with shaved-in designs. Citing a dress code policy, they separated him from other students and prevented him from going to lunch with his peers because they feared it would be too “distracting.” In 2013, Deborah Brown Community School, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, sent Tiana Parker home after telling the 7-year-old that her locks did not look “presentable.” In 2016, The School for Creative Studies, in Durham, North Carolina, prevented Black students from wearing traditional head wraps, or geles, a symbol used to represent the students’ connection with Africa—during Black History Month, no less! Mystic Valley Regional Charter School in Malden, Massachusetts, gave multiple detentions to twin sisters Deanna and Mya Cook for their hair extensions and prevented them from attending their junior prom in 2017.

School districts are not the only entities hiding their racism behind laws that provide cover. In 2017, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a “race-neutral grooming policy” used to justify rescinding a job offer to a woman who wore locks was not discriminatory, because hairstyles, while “culturally associated with race,” are not “immutable physical characteristics.” The Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal. Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) introduced companion bills last year in the House and Senate, expressly prohibiting discrimination based upon natural hair or hairstyles like twists and extensions that protect natural hair from weather, over-washing, and processing. Booker’s interest was piqued after 16-year-old New Jersey wrestler, Andrew Johnson, was ordered by a referee in 2018 to cut his dreadlocks or forfeit his match. Last year, California became the first state to ban workplace and school discrimination against Black people for wearing hairstyles such as braids, twists, and locks. New York followed shortly after.

DeAndre Arnold’s suspension is rightly receiving the national attention it deserves. Actress Gabrielle Union and retired NBA player Dwyane Wade, producers of the Oscar-nominated animated short film “Hair Love,” made DeAndre their plus-one to the 92nd Academy Awards last week. Forced to choose between cutting his hair and attending graduation, DeAndre chose to transfer to another school.

“We’re here for DeAndre, but it’s about more than that,” DeAndre’s mother, Sandy Arnold, told the Associated Press. “This is about all the other DeAndres that could come through Barbers Hill.”

Since DeAndre transferred to another school, television news station KHOU 11 has reported that the principal disciplined DeAndre’s cousin, sophomore Kaden Bradford, for violating the grooming policy. Like DeAndre, Kaden wears his hair in locks. He has been in in-school suspension since Jan. 31.

To have a backward rule around hair length for boys is bad enough, but the way the policy seems to target Black students is even worse. Singling out Black youth with long hair for punishment shows how prejudiced school officials will do anything, apply any rule, to achieve a bigoted result.","February 14, 2020",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
60,Beyond Tiananmen,https://www.brookings.edu/books/beyond-tiananmen/,N/A,"It has been thirteen years since soldiers of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) raced into the center of Beijing, ordered to recover “at any cost” the city’s most important landmark, Tiananmen Square, from student demonstrators. The U.S. and other Western countries recoiled in disgust after the horrific incident, and the relationship between the U.S. and China went from amity and strategic cooperation to hostility, distrust, and misunderstanding. Time has healed many of the wounds from those terrible days of June 1989, and bilateral strains have been eased in light of the countries’ joint opposition to international terrorism. Yet China and U.S. remain locked in opposition, as strategic thinkers and military planners on both sides plot future conflict scenarios with the other side as principal enemy. Polls indicate that most Americans consider China an “unfriendly” country, and anti-American sentiment is growing in China. According to Robert Suettinger, the calamity in Tiananmen Square marked a critical turning point in U.S.-China affairs. In Beyond Tiananmen, Suettinger traces the turbulent bilateral relationship since that time, with a particular focus on the internal political factors that shaped it. Through a series of candid anecdotes and observations, Suettinger sheds light on the complex and confused decision-making process that affected relations between the U.S. and China between 1989 and the end of the Clinton presidency in 2000. By illuminating the way domestic political ideas, beliefs, and prejudices affect foreign policymaking, Suettinger reveals policy decisions as outcomes of complex processes, rather than the results of grand strategic trends. He also refutes the view that strategic confrontation between the superpowers is inevitable. Suettinger sees considerable opportunity for cooperation and improvement in what is likely to be the single most important bilateral relationship of the twenty-first century. He cautions, however, that routine misperceptions of goals and policies between the two countries—unfortunate legacies of Tiananmen—could lead to an increasing level of hostility, with tragic consequences.",N/A,Brookings Institution,race prejudice

O’Hanlon,"The Senate is still due to consider ratifying the U.S.-Russia New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, though maybe not during the lame-duck session. Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) is now talking about delaying the vote, not stopping it entirely.

Ratification would be a modest step forward for arms control. Even more important, it would be a significant step forward for the U.S.-Russia relationship — which is working substantially better now than in years past.

In addition, the pact does not prejudge the prospects for moving toward the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons, sought by Presidents Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama and so many others. So skeptics of that idea need not worry about this treaty.

Nor does it impede Washington in its missile defense efforts. While some conservatives do not like the treaty’s allusion to missile defense, there is no binding language that constrains them.

New START is not a huge, landmark accomplishment. It’s not enough to warrant major bragging rights for the White House in the already-looming 2012 presidential race. But it is sound policy.

The specifics of the accord are simple enough. Only long-range nuclear systems are limited, though any follow-on treaty would presumably have to begin to account for the many thousands of warheads associated with tactical weapons, as well as surplus inventories in both countries’ arsenals.

Each country may have 700 operational launchers, including long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and nuclear-capable bombers. On those launchers, each side may deploy up to 1,550 countable warheads — though the total could be a few hundred more, since the treaty counts bombers as carrying just one warhead, regardless of actual loading.

These numbers represent reductions of roughly 10 percent relative to those in the soon-to-expire Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, signed by President George W. Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2002. To verify limits, each side is allowed up to 18 inspections a year on the other’s territory, as well as by satellite and other remote means.

These facts and figures are significant, and the new, lower limits are useful. They are likely to further reduce excessive nuclear stockpiles without opening up any invitation to the medium nuclear powers (with warhead arsenals in the low hundreds) to try to reach the nuclear superpower club while Moscow and Washington scale back.

But the treaty’s specific provisions are not the big thing here. Indeed, at a broader strategic level, I would have preferred that Bush’s more casual approach to arms control had succeeded. I agree with him that the United States and Russia should no longer be treating each other as prospective opponents in a nuclear war.

Along these lines, it is regrettable that treaty supporters feel obliged to promise more spending on already well-funded nuclear systems because we are soon going to have to make defense spending cuts to help reduce the deficit. Conventional forces may have to bear an even larger brunt as a result.

Alas, despite the logic of Bush’s simpler concept (including SORT, which was all of three pages), Russia found that approach unappealing. It denied Moscow the trappings of superpowerdom that only its nuclear weapons (and energy resources) provide in the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s demise. And U.S.-Russia relations suffered.

Thus, not as a matter of partisan politics or Cold War nostalgia or even love for treaties, but simply as an empirical decision, the Obama administration was right to return to a more formal arms-control methodology. Its hope was that the bilateral relationship would strengthen, creating other benefits around the world.

And those benefits have emerged. The progress in the U.S.-Russia relationship has probably been the most important foreign policy accomplishment of this administration. At a narrow, arms-control level, progress on New START helped pave the way last spring for the Washington nuclear summit, which included commitments from many states to further secure sensitive nuclear materials and facilities around the world.

Obama was in a stronger position to convene that summit and press other countries for new commitments because he had begun to put superpower arms control back on track.

New START, combined with Obama’s wise decision to restructure the proposed U.S. missile defense system for central Europe, gave a boost to ties between Moscow and Washington that has helped U.S. foreign policy in other ways as well.

Perhaps one-third of all North Atlantic Treaty Organization supplies for the Afghanistan war, for example, now flow through what is called the northern distribution system. Several routes make up the NDS: Some pass through Russia; others involve former Soviet republics (like Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan), where Moscow can create major obstacles if it wants. Yet the flow of supplies has dramatically increased in recent years.

Most of all, the U.S.-Russia relationship is now helping apply greater pressure on Iran. Moscow has agreed to far tighter United Nations Security Council sanctions on Iran’s high-technology trade, and it recently refused to sell Tehran advanced surface-to-air missiles.

Regrettably, after a long delay, Russia did help Iran begin operations at its Bushehr nuclear reactor complex — reminding us, if any had forgotten, that the U.S.-Russia relationship remains far from perfect. But the progress has still been substantial.

Moreover, while Moscow has not relented in its quasi-occupation of two autonomous zones in Georgia, there have been no subsequent Russian tank marches in Tbilisi or elsewhere. Russia has also helped tighten U.N. sanctions on North Korea after its 2009 nuclear test.

Those who claim, nostalgically, that U.S. politics used to “stop at the water’s edge” base their arguments more on myth than on fact. That is not really the norm in U.S. foreign policymaking — except at unusual times of national unity, like World War II.

The GOP need not obstruct New START out of any political strategy aimed at recovering the Senate and the White House in 2012. It can vote its conscience on this treaty and base political strategy on other, mostly domestic issues.

GOP senators should join Democrats in supporting the treaty. It is solid enough to warrant the 85 or more votes that arms-control pacts have often received in the past.","November 18, 2010",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
62,Are Trump supporters anti-Muslim?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/are-trump-supporters-anti-muslim/,George Hawley,"When political commentators discuss the rise of “populism” in Western democracies, United States President Donald Trump’s 2016 election victory is often the first example named — typically followed by the “Brexit” vote in the United Kingdom, the right-wing governments in Hungary and Poland, and growing right-wing strength in many other countries. As the world’s largest economy, as well as a world leader in culture and politics, it is understandable that the U.S. receives disproportionate attention. The power of this variety of right-wing politics in the U.S. should not be overstated, however. Based on my reading of the other papers in this project and my conversations with their authors, I increasingly suspect that the prospects for populism (if that is the correct term for what we are examining) are stronger in Europe than in the United States.

Although Donald Trump managed to win the Republican nomination and subsequently the U.S. presidency on a nativist and anti-Muslim platform, the substance of his presidency has not been as disruptive as many people expected. We should not downplay the importance of President Trump’s rhetoric, but if we focus exclusively on policy, the U.S. has changed little over the last two years. The promised “Muslim ban” faced major legal challenges, resulting in a much more limited policy. That policy’s long-term impact on the nation’s demography will likely be minimal and the next Democratic president will almost certainly reverse it. The Trump Administration has made little progress on its promised border wall, nor has the U.S. experienced a significant decline in immigration.

It is true that President Trump has slashed the number of refugees admitted to the United States, which disproportionately affects Muslims, but refugees have always represented a very small percentage of immigrants to the U.S. — only about three million refugees have been resettled in the U.S. since 1980. Undocumented immigrants were furthermore deported at higher rates under President Obama than under President Trump. This is not necessarily because of the Trump Administration’s lack of desire to deport undocumented immigrants. Rather, under President Trump, states and municipalities under Democratic control have been less eager to cooperate with federal agencies. The executive branch’s bureaucratic incompetence may also play a role.

The Trump Administration will not be in power forever. Even if President Trump wins a second term as president, second terms are historically less productive than first terms. It is additionally unlikely the Trump will ever again enjoy Republican majorities in both chambers of congress. As more time passes, I find it decreasingly likely that Trump will fundamentally transform the United States in terms of immigration, foreign policy, or the nation’s relationship with Islam and Muslims.

As more time passes, I find it decreasingly likely that Trump will fundamentally transform the United States in terms of immigration, foreign policy, or the nation’s relationship with Islam and Muslims.

In other papers in this project, we learned about increasingly powerful political parties dedicated to immigration restrictions, of well-known political entrepreneurs focused entirely on restricting Islam’s influence in European societies, and of right-wing populist governments consolidating their power. Although further right-wing populist victories in Europe are not inevitable, in recent years these movements have effectively shifted the political conversation in their own direction. Many mainstream parties have begun to embrace talking points once relegated to the far-right.

This is less the case in the U.S. Trump’s victory has not fundamentally changed the Republican Party or led to substantively significant immigration policy changes. Trump’s electoral base furthermore does not seem particularly concerned about Muslim immigration as such — which is not to say it is especially tolerant.

We can reasonably criticize President Trump for promoting anti-Muslim prejudice, and he may have played a role in promoting these attitudes. A recent poll published by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding showed a small but statistically significant increase in its Islamophobia index over the last year. A poll conducted by the think tank New America additionally found that Republicans are especially likely to view Muslims with suspicion. On the other hand, we should remember that, on average, Republicans have long been likely to express negative views of Muslims and Islam. We should therefore investigate whether we saw a spike in these attitudes after Donald Trump entered the political arena. In my own analysis of the American National Election Survey data, I found little evidence that this occurred. In the 2012 survey, the mean feeling thermometer score for Muslims among all Republican identifiers was about 38. In the 2016 survey, conducted after then-candidate Trump called for a total ban on Muslim immigration, the mean score among all Republican identifiers was a bit higher — about 45. This is not a definitive finding, of course, but it does indicate that President Trump has not ushered in an unprecedented era of anti-Muslim animus, even among Republicans.","December 4, 2019",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
63,Around the halls: Brookings scholars discuss a much-needed revision to America’s diversity data,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/around-the-halls-brookings-scholars-discuss-a-much-needed-revision-to-americas-diversity-data/,"William H. Frey, Chiraag Bains","Twenty-seven years since the last revision in 1997, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has altered its Statistical Policy Directive No. 15 (SPD 15)—providing a much-needed update in the standards for defining race and ethnic categories for use in data collection across all government agencies.

The revised standards are not perfect, and OMB promises to continue monitoring their use. But they are a marked improvement in light of ongoing shifts in U.S. racial and ethnic demographics, because they will allow more flexibility for individuals in identifying how they see themselves.

The new changes will affect the “minimal categories” for data collection—the race and ethnicity data that every federal survey will be required to ask about. In addition to the five “race” categories that have been used for decades (reflecting persons identifying as White, Black or African American, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or American Indian or Alaska Native), the new minimal categories will also include “Hispanic or Latino” and “Middle Eastern or North African” (or MENA). These two new categories are not traditional racial categories; therefore, this classification will be noted as one of “race and/or ethnicity.”

The addition of the Hispanic or Latino category results from the elimination of the separate “Hispanic/Non Hispanic” question which was previously asked in addition the race question. Research from the Census Bureau and others showed that when posed with separate ethnicity and race questions, a large share of Hispanic or Latino respondents did not identify with traditional racial categories and that a “combined” race/ethnic question yielded far more valid results. In this new classification, Hispanic or Latino respondents, like those of other groups, can choose to identify with other racial categories as well, but will not be required to.

The addition of the MENA category for people of Middle Eastern and North African descent stems from years of lobbying from MENA-related communities. Prior to the new standards, MENA was often offered as subcategory of “White.”

Perhaps most importantly, the new standards dictate that as a default, government agencies will collect data on detailed race and ethnic groups within each of the seven minimal race and ethnic categories. And where possible, agencies will provide “check boxes” for the five largest detailed groups (based on the 2020 census) as well as an open-ended “write in” box to capture other groups. (One exception is for the American Indian or Alaska Native category, for which only a write-in option is required.) Moreover, the instructions on questionnaires that allow both minimal and detailed categories encourage respondents to select “all that apply,” thus facilitating the collection of multiracial and multiethnic categories.

Clearly, the expansion of the data that government agencies collect will provide far greater opportunities to examine racial and ethnic disparities on measures of economic well-being, health, education, and more from variety of sources. With that said, OMB is aware of the challenges involved with their implementation—it provides guidelines for their presentation and promises to maintain a standing Interagency Committee to carry out continuing research and review of SPD 15. Now, it is up to policymakers, scholars, and practitioners to communicate their experiences with the new standards to the wider network of stakeholders and agencies in order to take advantage of this long overdue effort to improve the nation’s diversity data.

Americans deserve federal policy that works for all of us. From housing to health care, good jobs to quality schools, transportation to environmental protection, public officials must ensure that everyone has access to opportunity and no one is disadvantaged on account of their background. That idea is at the core of President Joe Biden’s equity agenda, which I had the privilege of driving forward as deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council.

Serving all populations requires collecting better data. Without accurate data, we can’t assess whether government programs are fair and equally accessible, or if they discriminate against or underserve Americans based on race, ethnicity, or other characteristics.

OMB’s revisions to SPD 15 mark a significant step forward in this effort. The use of a single combined question asking about “race and/or ethnicity” and encouraging people to “select all that apply” will produce more reliable data in our increasingly diverse and multiracial country. The addition of “Middle Eastern or North African” as a minimum required category—previously nested under “White”—better accords with how those groups see themselves. The elimination of “Negro,” “Far East,” and other outdated or offensive terms was long overdue.

Perhaps the most important change is OMB’s requirement that agencies collect detailed, disaggregated data as a default. While broad racial and ethnic categories are valuable, they can mask differences within diverse groups. For example, aggregate data about Asian Americans may obscure the disproportionately high rates of poverty among Hmong Americans or liver cancer for Laotian women. Now, all agencies must include check boxes for the largest subgroups within a category (e.g., African American, Jamaican, Haitian, and others under “Black or African American”) and write-in fields. They must obtain permission from Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to seek more limited information.

Critically, the new standards are based in evidence and extensive engagement. OMB reviewed 20,000 public comments and held 94 listening sessions, three virtual townhalls, and a tribal consultation. It also drew from empirical research conducted by the Census Bureau and others. In 2015, the Bureau tested different question formats and terminology with a representative sample of 1.2 million households and 75,000 follow-up interviews. It found that a combined race/ethnicity question more accurately reflected how Latinos identify in real life: Over 70% preferred to check only “Hispanic or Latino” rather than also select a separate race. Further research will be important to build on OMB’s evidence-based decisions, including on how to encourage people to select multiple categories when appropriate.

OMB’s changes will enable better policymaking. More accurate, granular data can help law enforcement target their resources to combat hate crimes, direct agencies’ outreach toward groups eligible for but unenrolled in public benefits, and illuminate the need to translate government materials into additional languages. The updates to SPD 15 will also facilitate civil rights enforcement, as agencies and private litigants depend on federal datasets to prove and remedy discrimination in redistricting, zoning, lending, employment, and other contexts. In short, the new standards will support more just, inclusive, and responsive government action.

Most public policy researchers will welcome OMB’s changes in the standards for defining race mainly because the previous composition didn’t make much sense. For example, people of MENA descent were previously categorized as “White,” yet more often than not, these individuals do not see themselves as such, and white people make distinctions from them. Moreover, due to their unique historical and cultural heritage, people who identify as MENA often do not identify as Black as well. All of this is complicated by the fact that most enslaved individuals in the Americas came from West Africa, not from the Middle East or Northern Africa.

Expanding the number of racial groups to reflect societal dynamics will allow researchers to better document the impacts of policies on people who “share” a common history and/or lived experiences. MENA groups represent a wide range of religious and ethnic backgrounds, from Persians to Israelis. However, reports of discrimination are shared across many of these groups, particularly among those who identify as Muslim or speak Arabic.

This comes with the understanding that race is fundamentally a social construct, with limited to no functional basis in biology. Meaning, societies assign value to the racial identities they create or endorse, shaping how policy views and treats groups and individuals. In the case of people who identify as MENA, it’s less clear how policy supposedly privileges and/or prejudices them because we must impute MENA identities from various sources instead of using a direct, self-identified data source.

In order to tease out different impacts of policy, particularly discriminatory effects, researchers need more accurate categories to see how the distribution of resources and effects plays out. Previously, the experiences of Middle Easterners and Northern Africans have been masked by ill-fitting racial categories. The new categories will enable groups that have been hidden by those racial categories to see themselves in policy, strengthening analyses based on race.

As I wrote in an op-ed for The Hill, while OMB’s new standards for race and ethnicity are a positive development for Hispanic or Latino and MENA individuals, they do not solve many of the most pressing data challenges facing American Indians and Alaska Natives.

The federal government’s concept of “race” is a particularly ill-fitting paradigm for Indigenous people. As a result of centuries of colonization as well as other complex factors around American Indian and Alaska Native identity, these individuals are classified as multiracial at a higher rate than any other OMB-defined racial group. Indeed, across the country, just 23% of American Indians and Alaska Natives identify as that race alone and non-Hispanic.

Because of this, my colleagues and I have previously proposed that the U.S. federal government should follow the example of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand and pose a separate question asking about Indigenous identity or descent, in addition to the existing race and ethnicity questions. Instead, OMB’s new standards will mean that most American Indians and Alaska Natives will continue to be classified under the catch-all “two-or-more races” category.

Despite this, OMB’s new guidance could still help improve data around American Indians and Alaska Natives. Buried in the guidance is a set of new recommendations for the Presentation of Data on Race and Ethnicity by federal agencies. In particular, OMB recommends two approaches that are currently relatively rare for presenting race and ethnicity data. “Approach 1” allows federal agencies to report race and ethnicity data for all individuals identifying as a racial or ethnic group, alone or in combination. “Approach 2” allows federal agencies to report as many detailed race and ethnicity combinations as possible. These new approaches for presenting race and ethnicity data could pull millions of American Indians and Alaska Natives out of the “two-or-more races” classification and ensure they are fully visible in federal data.

Federal agencies should embrace these new approaches. While they won’t solve all the data problems that Indian Country is contending with, they nonetheless have the potential both to improve the quality of research around American Indians and Alaska Natives, and more fully illustrate the diversity of Indigenous people in the U.S.

Data points represent people and communities. And in a world increasingly influenced by data, it’s more important than ever to ensure that the ways we represent diverse groups within public data are effective and equitable. OMB’s changes are moving in the right direction.

In an increasingly diverse America, there are symbolic and psychological gains from enabling more people not to have to tick the “other” box. Not everybody sees themselves represented the way that I do on surveys and censuses. My race and ethnicity category—white, Irish descent—is a baseline category on almost every form I’ve filled out. For me, completing a survey does not provoke reflections on identity or belonging, and that’s a privilege easily taken for granted. For the large number of Americans who don’t identify with the previous racial categories, including many Latinos and individuals from the Middle East and North Africa, these changes will likely be welcomed.

There are also policy gains from more inclusive federal data. When groups are excluded from data, they can be invisibilized—omitted from sampling in survey design, and thus excluded from research processes and policy design. This regularly happens with monolithic categories such as “Latino,” which spans ethnic groups across South and Central America with markedly different histories, experiences, and challenges within the U.S.

In my area of expertise (climate and environmental justice), having an accurate and detailed understanding of race and ethnicity is increasingly crucial for designing policy that can direct resources to underrepresented groups. In the U.S., environmental injustices are highly correlated with race and ethnicity. Having a more comprehensive understanding of demographic data, especially at the local level, can help policymakers identify overburdened populations and ensure that our policies and decisionmaking processes accurately respond to their unique vulnerabilities, concerns, and perspectives. OMB’s changes will help researchers like myself, civic organizations, and policymakers better understand environmental injustices and their solutions for a greater diversity of Americans.

While I am very supportive of the effort to increase the representation of different racial and cultural groups in OMB’s surveys, I also want to raise a note of caution about doing so. In my long experience with survey design and research (most recently in the field of well-being economics), I have found that there is always a trade-off between adding complexity and granularity to surveys and the logistics of administering them and using the results for comparisons across places and cohorts and over time. In terms of administration—i.e., fielding the surveys—too much length and complexity tend to reduce response rates, as the longer and more complex they are, the less likely people will be willing to respond. In terms of comparisons, it is key to keep a core group of measures consistent over time—a core that can be supplemented by new measures and metrics, but should not be replaced unless absolutely necessary.

The risk is that the new data will not be comparable across cohorts and over time, which would result in the loss of valuable information and lessons. The addition of Hispanic and Latino as an ethnicity in addition to a race, for example, has created confusion and a lack of comparability in many instances (accepting that there are also obvious benefits).

Thus, any discussion of how many and which new indicators to add to the OMB guidelines should take those tradeoffs into account. In my most recent experience in trying to design and include measures of community well-being in addition to individual well-being in the guidelines for statistical offices around the world, there is no magic bullet. But there is some consensus on the need to retain a core group of the original measures in surveys, as well as the option to include additional metrics in modules designed to achieve the new objectives. At the least, this is one way to think about proceeding, and also allows for the ability to test the robustness and reliability of the new metrics.","May 7, 2024",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
64,Teacher perceptions and race,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/teacher-perceptions-and-race/,Dick Startz,"When it comes to student behavior, what’s polite or rude—what counts as acting out versus what’s seen as healthy youthful exuberance—depends not only on actual behavior but on how teachers read behavior. Black and white American cultures are still sufficiently different in that how teachers read behavior depends in part on the teacher’s race. New research shows that black and white teachers give very different evaluations of behavior of black students. When a black student has a black teacher that teacher is much, much less likely to see behavioral problems than when the same black student has a white teacher.

New research by Adam Wright, “Teachers’ Perceptions of Students’ Disruptive Behavior: The Effect of Racial Congruence and Consequences for School Suspension,” documents that black teachers have much less negative views of black student behavior than do white teachers. (Conflict of interest notice…hmmm no, braggin’ notice: Wright is one of my PhD students.) Wright looks first at teacher evaluations of behavior, and then at data on school suspensions. Let’s begin with the teacher evaluations.

Wright uses data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study to follow the experience of more than 20,000 students in kindergarten, first, third, and fifth grade. During the elementary school years, teachers were asked to assess a number of noncognitive skills. The measure of interest here is “externalizing problem behaviors,” which asks how often the student “argues, fights, gets angry, acts impulsively, and disrupts ongoing activities.” Notice that we see a measure of teacher perception, rather than counts of disciplinary events. Wright focuses on externalizing behavior because this measure is highly correlated with school suspensions.

On a scale in which the average measure of externalizing behavior is normalized to zero, white and Hispanic students average -0.07, while black students average +0.37. (Asian students average -0.38.) So on average, black students are viewed as having much worse behavior—which presumably reflects some combination of objectively worse behavior and perceived worse behavior.

Wright does something very clever, taking advantage of the fact that students are observed several times and that we know which students are in which classes with which teachers. Wright asks how black students are rated by black teachers, controlling for both the average rating of an individual student by all his teachers and for the average rating a particular teacher of all of her students in a given class. What this means is that Wright can identify how a black student’s behavior is perceived by a black teacher as compared to how the same student is perceived by white teachers. The procedure also adjusts for the possibility that black teachers are just more “easy going,” because the average rating given in a class is effectively subtracted off. So Wright is arguably identifying a causal effect of black students being matched with black teachers.

Bottom line: black teachers are much less likely to find problems with black students than white teachers are with the same students. The difference is enormous, accounting for about half the black/white externalizing behavior gap. (Remember that the data does not tell us whether black teachers have different perceptions of black students or whether student/teacher race matching leads to objectively different behavior.) For black students, being matched with a black teacher matters.

How about white or Hispanic students being matched with white or Hispanic teachers, respectively? Nope, no discernable differences in externalizing behavior. (To be clear, black teachers rate white students about the same as do white teachers.) In other words, being race matched matters a lot for black students but not for others.

Wright drills down further. First—and this is probably unsurprising—the effect of race matching is entirely due to the evaluations given to black boys. There isn’t a noticeable difference for black girls. Second, the effect of matching is limited to the year of the match. When Wright checked reports of black students when they were assigned to white teachers following a year with a black teacher he found no lingering effects of that year of being race-matched. This suggests that the findings reflect teacher perceptions rather than real behavioral differences since we might expect improvements in behavior to persist the following year—and that’s not what happens.

Wright then turns to the question of suspension. As is well known, black students are much more likely to be suspended than are white students. Wright shows that the more times a black student is matched with a black teacher, the less likely that student is to be suspended. Unfortunately, the data does not note the grade in which a suspension happened. It is reasonable to speculate that most suspensions come in later grades and that the finding is due in part to the effect of student-teacher race matching in earlier grades. We can’t be sure of this however, and some part of the finding may also be due to fewer suspensions of black students during years they have black teachers.

The difference in suspension rates is large. Taking these findings at face value, Wright estimates that if we doubled exposure of black students to black teachers, the black-white suspension gap would fall in half. Because of data limitations, it’s not possible to test whether black students’ likelihood of suspension changes when they move from a black teacher to a white teacher. Instead, Wright looks at black students who enter the same school at kindergarten but are exposed to different percentages of black teachers through eighth grade. So the causal interpretations about suspensions are less certain than are the interpretations about behavior reports.

In summary, black teacher perceptions about the behavior of black boys is very different than the perceptions of white teachers. This doesn’t happen for other racial groups. None of this necessarily suggests malice or prejudice or favoritism on anyone’s part. It does suggest one more way that race still matters in our schools.","February 22, 2016",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
65,Why the World Anti-doping Agency should revisit its cannabis ban,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-the-world-anti-doping-agency-should-revisit-its-cannabis-ban-2/,"Rashawn Ray, John Hudak","Richardson admitted to smoking marijuana to cope with the death of her biological mother. Troublingly, Richardson was informed about the death of her mother by a reporter just days before the biggest race of her life. And while the suspension decision may comport with the World Anti-Doping Agency’s (WADA) rules, it does not mean the policy is righteous or reflective of scientific understanding of cannabis. This may be why the White House is seeking to meet with WADA.

In the wake of Richardson’s suspension, WADA has an opportunity to do what countries around the world and states across the U.S. are doing: reexamine the basis for the laws and rules regarding cannabis and chart a path forward that is more informed than punitive. Three dozen U.S. states have passed medical cannabis laws since the mid-1990s, while Canada, Uruguay, 18 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis. Major sporting agencies including the NBA, NFL, and MLB have made significant changes to how they penalize cannabis.

These policy changes reflect a better understanding of cannabis’s relative harms, particularly when compared to the sensationalized propaganda that the government and media have peddled. These reforms also recognized that cannabis laws were crafted on a fallacious set of arguments that advance racial prejudices and criminalization. Not only was the foundation of cannabis laws racist in nature, but the enforcement of those laws, even today, embody systemic racial bias. According to the ACLU, Black Americans are nearly four times more likely than white Americans to be arrested for a cannabis-related offense, despite usage rates between Blacks and whites being essentially the same.

A supermajority of Americans has had enough with drug prohibition and appreciate a reevaluation of laws and policies. However, the reason a state or country may change its laws can differ from the reasons a sporting organization may consider banning a substance. WADA should convene a group of experts who conduct scientific research on cannabis as well as those who study its effects in clinical settings. Some of this research will reflect the positive qualities cannabis provides. The panel also should consider other physiological impacts of cannabis on an athlete, including how the same depressive qualities that may assist one’s anxiety may hinder training or performance. The effects of cannabis and THC, the main psychoactive compound in cannabis, should be compared to the effects of alcohol, cigarettes, and cannabidiol/CBD, which WADA has recently removed as a banned substance. This panel should also consider the manner in which THC testing occurs and what the test is seeking to identify. Specifically, research on active THC versus metabolites should inform WADA’s decision on how to test athletes and how to potentially penalize them.

Finally, WADA must consider the history and optics of anti-cannabis policies. WADA says that cannabis does not embody the “spirit of the sport” and is inconsistent with how athletes should behave as role models. This is a problematic aspect, particularly since cannabis did not become a banned substance until 1998. Considering the late 1990s were the height of mass incarceration that disproportionately incarcerated Black people for marijuana, the controversy surrounding Richardson’s positive test and suspension should be a moment to reconsider that broader policy.

Richardson looks very much the part of those most criminalized by the war on cannabis in the United States: Black, young, and from an urban area. While Richardson will miss an opportunity to compete for gold in Tokyo, back in her home country, hundreds of thousands of Black and Latino Americans will miss out on their dreams for upward mobility as the racial targeting of drug laws give them a record and alter their future. This injustice is the source of anger and vitriol directed toward WADA, and the reality of that injustice must be part of any conversation surrounding drug testing procedures.

Richardson’s situation speaks to a cultural flaw in how far we have to go to grapple with culpability, coping, criminality, empathy and respectability politics. While she has been criticized by some about her nails, hair, and eyelashes, to others, Richardson is a “shero.” As she so aptly noted on The Today Show, “Don’t judge me because I am human. I’m you, I just happen to run a little faster.” Maybe the type of empathy, humanity and maturity that a 21-year-old who recently lost her mother is able to convey should be adapted to revisit cannabis policy in sports and in our society.","August 4, 2021",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
66,"75 years after Auschwitz, anti-Semitism is on the rise",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/75-years-after-auschwitz-anti-semitism-is-on-the-rise/,Walter Reich,"On January 27, 1945, Soviet troops liberated Auschwitz. The date is now consecrated as International Holocaust Remembrance Day, as the world vowed never to allow murderous anti-Semitism to recur. Yet 75 years later, attacking Jews has once again become socially acceptable in many countries — across the left-right ideological spectrum, and among different groups that blame Jews for their grievances and oppression.

The recent eruptions of anti-Semitism in America have awakened us to a prejudice that has long resided, in quiet ways and in many forms, in this country. And the part of it that now disguises itself as anti-Zionism — hatred of the Jewish state that was established in the wake of the Holocaust as a refuge for Jews — has even seemed, to some, virtuous, a sentiment they believe puts them in humanity’s moral vanguard.

And anti-Semitism has returned, in part, because the general public’s knowledge about the Holocaust — of what exactly it was, who exactly was murdered in it, how many were killed, and how anti-Semitism spawned it — has diminished. For a time, that knowledge discredited anti-Semitism and those who indulged in it. But the passing of survivors who experienced the Holocaust and could testify to it, the denial and minimization of the Holocaust, and the hijacking of the word itself to advance numerous other causes, great and small, all combined to diminish its memory. The horrifying knowledge of where anti-Semitism can lead has been, in large measure, lost in a miasma of forgetting, ignorance, denial, confusion, appropriation, and obfuscation.

As a former director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, many of whose uncles, aunts, and cousins, and a grandmother, were murdered in the Holocaust; as a professor who has taught a generation of students about the memory of the Holocaust; as a psychiatrist who is well aware of humanity’s repertoire of hatred and brutality; as a professor of international affairs; and as a student of Jewish history who is deeply aware of the many times masses of Jews were murdered or expelled simply because they were Jews, I watch anti-Semitism’s global resurgence, so soon after the Holocaust, with alarm and foreboding. Could murderous anti-Semitism, on a large scale, resume in our time? Could “never again,” vowed so solemnly and so repeatedly after the Holocaust, revert to “yet again”?","January 28, 2020",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
67,Discrimination and prejudice in development,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/discrimination-and-prejudice-in-development/,Célestin Monga,"Years ago, I was appointed senior economist in the Europe and Central Asia department of the World Bank. Despite my being appointed through a tough, open, and competitive process, some of my colleagues were anxious that a Cameroonian was picked for the position. They wondered whether I would be able to handle the highly complex fiscal, monetary, and economic issues facing these countries, all engaged in the European Union accession process. Having done research on the economics of monetary integration, I was actually well prepared for the job.

My colleagues’ dark prediction did materialize. When my appointment was officially communicated to the various countries under my responsibility, one of the ministers of finance reacted with shock and horror. A Ph.D.-holder herself, she only inquired about my citizenship. When told that I was Cameroonian, she did not read my books and papers, or examine my credentials. The minister publicly voiced her disapproval, telling news media that she was deeply disappointed that the World Bank would select “someone from Africa” to be their senior economist and advise them on complex macroeconomic issues.

While I was stress-free, my superiors were not. The World Bank sent an official letter to the European minister to diplomatically condemn her comments, raise the possibility that she might have been misquoted by the media, express the wish that she would take the first opportunity to clarify her statements. She angrily responded with an even stronger statement, asserting that I probably did not know where her country was located and might need a map to find it.

The World Bank stood its ground. It kept that country in my portfolio despite the minister’s threat—on which she actually followed through: During my three-year tenure in that position, her country reduced macroeconomic dialogue to a bare minimum and basically suspended all budget support operations. When I traveled twice a year to her country on routine macroeconomic monitoring missions, she told me, with admirable and bizarre honesty, that her anger was “not against me personally,” but that she simply could not accept the idea that an African economist would be assigned to her country.

I reflected on such issues in my books “Nihilism and Negritude” (Harvard University Press, 2016) and “Un Bantou en Asie” (PUF, 2011). Writing the books made me think about other angles of the problem, most notably the superiority complex or even racist attitudes exhibited by some development experts. In the African context in particular, they often fall into the trap of self-righteousness, which prevents them from really engaging with stakeholders and enriching their understanding. Armed with strong beliefs in their academic credentials, they fail to recognize their ignorance of the terrain, the people, or the suitability of their proposed policies in places where they spend little time and interact with minuscule, nonrepresentative samples of politicians.

Many of the development experts who set the policy agenda across Africa are recent university graduates with very little professional experience in any field, and none about life and policies in developing countries. Yet, they do not lack supreme confidence in their diagnostics of the problems or in the pertinence of their prescriptions. Not surprisingly, their policy advice, provided on the basis of a fuzzy understanding of country context, is often of poor quality, irrelevant, and harmful. The myth of dominant “donor” knowledge and the power of money (channeled through loans and grants to cash-strapped governments constantly facing crises) can seal the fate of nations.

Critics of the development industry tend to focus too narrowly on the sometimes-imperial public discourse of the visible individuals at the helm of major institutions. The problem goes well beyond asymmetric power relationships between those who have the funding and conditionalities, and the poor-country policymakers constrained by their macroeconomic crises and tense domestic situations. It is useful here to take the analysis toward the idea that “power is everywhere” (Michel Foucault), disseminated and embodied in the discourse, practices, and “regimes of truth” across the development industry.

The deleterious consequences of prejudice by some members of the “donor community” and their misuse of power cannot be underestimated. First, government officials who are subjected to the superiority complex and disdain from the representatives of foreign aid institutions eventually stop sharing honest opinions, as they must do whatever it takes in order to secure external financing. African policymakers often feel helpless when they are told in no uncertain terms (generally in writing) that their major strategy and policy papers must be validated by the all-too powerful “donors” as a prerequisite for discussions about foreign aid.

The sense of powerlessness worsens and becomes a feeling of being blackmailed when they realize that getting the approval and formal clearance from a small number of (sometimes ill-informed) multilateral partners is also a condition for securing aid from almost any bilateral source. Yet, the world expects these countries to set their own objectives, choose their strategies and policies, and fully own the results—whatever they may be. I once attended a workshop in Ouagadougou to discuss Burkina Faso’s health sector strategy. Two-thirds of the participants were from foreign countries and organizations—each of them with strong views and preferences on what the country’s health policy should be. Who would be accountable if the recommended policy eventually proved to be erroneous?

Second, the opportunity costs of these learning deficits are substantial. A perverted incentive system emerges, as the other actors (business communities, civil society organizations, and people in poor countries) feel disempowered in discussions and decisions about the future of their own country. Local stakeholders always have precious knowledge of the country and the real status of government accounts and programs, which they may not be able to share with the visiting experts of the aid community. This asymmetry of information often leads to the use of inaccurate data. Without honest and transparent debates over policy options, the wrong diagnostics are often made, followed by erroneous and harmful policy advice. Ultimately, a vicious circle unfolds: Citizens in recipient countries question the legitimacy and ownership of public policies imposed from outside, which their government officials accept either because they have no other choice if they urgently need financing or because of the political allegiance of their leaders, their intellectual laziness, and their poor organizational and governance skills.

Prejudice in the development business does not only come from outside. There is also entrenched self-doubt, self-hatred, and various forms of sociopolitical ills from within the continent. Racist attitudes are sometimes internalized by African elites themselves, illustrating a profound deficit of self-esteem (one of Africa’s main deficits) and a lingering social disease, which could be called “postcolonialism stress disorder.” As a World Bank senior official, I once traveled to an African country with my assistant who, despite being African herself, was light-skinned and easily seen as a Caucasian. The authorities had been alerted of my arrival and dispatched a protocol team to welcome us at the airport. Despite the late-night flight, the hot and humid weather, the government officers were there to pick us up upon our arrival. But they did not know me and did not have a picture. They waited in the customs area holding a sign with my name. I introduced myself and thanked them for the effort and hospitality.

They barely responded to me. They both rushed to my assistant with large smiles, called her “Dr. Monga,” and welcomed her very kindly. One of them turned around and ordered me to pick up the suitcases from the luggage carousel. My assistant tried to explain that she was only accompanying me on the trip. With a surprised look on his face, one of the protocol officers eventually apologized and confessed: “We thought that the white lady was Dr. Monga, and you her assistant. Sorry.”

Prejudice and racism are still too common across Africa—often within the same ethnic groups Superficial differences in physical appearances or cultural background are too often exploited by cynical political entrepreneurs to build constituencies, create conflicts among poor communities, position themselves for rents and state capture, and generate what I have called in my work negative social capital. The weaponization of ethnicity in particular carries heavy implications for economic transformation and the collective quest for prosperity and social peace. Addressing these issues would improve the quality of public policies, and foster growth and social inclusion.","July 15, 2020",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
68,The Russian invasion of Ukraine shows racism has no boundaries,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-shows-racism-has-no-boundaries/,Rashawn Ray,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is “undisguised terror,” as described by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In a matter of days, hundreds of people have been killed, thousands are displaced, and hundreds of thousands are aiming to flee to border countries that accept refugees. Newborn babies are being placed in underground bunkers and men over the age of 18 are barred from leaving and asked instead to pick up arms and fight. There are images of courageous women staying in Ukraine to do the same.

The United States and many other countries have instituted severe economic sanctions to try to deter Russia’s offensive military tactics. And yet, Vladimir Putin seems set on trying to reclaim Ukrainian land through strong military force. At his first State of the Union address, President Biden enhanced sanctions by “closing off American airspace to all Russian flights.” The economic impacts on the Russian economy will be far-reaching and the human impacts will be generational.

So far, Russia does not seem deterred by the sanctions. Videos of the brutality are painful to watch. And the images of people trying to flee battle-stricken areas and cross the Ukrainian border into other countries further highlight the stain and peril of human survival. This journey has proved to be particularly challenging for Black people who, even during a life-and-death situation, have found themselves running into racist barriers to their safety and freedom.

There are many reports of Black people being refused at border crossings in favor of white Ukrainians, leaving them stuck at borders for days in brutal conditions. Ukraine stated they would first allow women and children on trains and transport out of the country to flee the Russian invasion. However, it seems they meant Ukrainian and European women and children. Videos show Black people being pushed off trains and Black drivers being reprimanded and stalled by Ukrainians as they try to flee. There are even reports of animals being allowed on trains before Africans.

Black students and athletes are not exempt from these racial barriers. Professional Ukrainian basketball player, Maurice Creek, who is originally from Maryland and played college basketball for Indiana University and George Washington University, was stuck in a bomb shelter in Mykolaiv, Ukraine. He is headed for Romania to try and get a flight to the United States. Ukrainian medical student, Korrine Sky, who is from Zimbabwe and lives in Great Britain, stated that trying to leave Ukraine is like “Squid Games” with Ukrainians and Europeans at the top of the hierarchy, people from India and the Middle East in the middle, and Africans at the bottom. Though Sky’s perspective is disturbing, there is relevant history that people may not know.

Africans attending schools in what is now Ukraine date back to the 1920s, and the Soviet Union (now Russia) started formally recruiting Africans to attend college and professional schools in 1957. Not a coincidence, 1957 was the year that Ghana gained its independence from Great Britain. The Soviet Union wanted to try and build more positive relations with African countries and showcase to the world their growing diplomacy. When Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, scholarships to African students substantially decreased. However, African students still found schools in the area appealing. Today, over 16,000 African people are studying in Ukraine, accounting for more than 20% of Ukraine’s international students.

Though the pathway to a visa in Ukraine and less expensive education costs are appealing to African students, economic depressions in southeastern Europe resulted in the rise of anti-immigrant prejudices and racial discrimination against Africans. Following a series of race-related murders of Africans in 2007, Ukraine passed anti-racism legislation. Hate crimes decreased to a certain extent. Still, Africans report regular occurrences of racial prejudice and name-calling (like “monkey”).

Comments made by Ukrainian officials and journalists covering the conflict reveal this deep-seated racial bias. In describing the traumatic impact of the Russian invasion to the BBC, Ukraine’s former deputy general prosecutor David Sakvarelidze stated: “It is really emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blond hair being killed, children being killed every day with Putin’s missiles.” Al Jazeera English news anchor, Peter Dobbie, described people in Ukraine who were fleeing to Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova: “We are playing some of the latest pictures of refugees on trains trying to get on trains or get out of Ukraine. And what’s compelling is just looking at them the way they are dressed. These are prosperous, middle-class people. These are obviously not refugees trying to get away from areas in the Middle East that are still in a big state of war. These are not people trying to get away from areas in North Africa. They look like any European family that you would live next door to.” On CBS News, senior correspondent Charlie D’Agata reporting from Kyiv stated: “With all due respect, this not a place like Iraq or Afghanistan that has seen conflict raging for decades. This is a relatively civilized, relatively European, I have to choose those words carefully too, city where you wouldn’t expect that or hope that it’s not going to happen. So it’s partly human nature…”

“European” has become a code word for white and a justification of the primary reason that people should care about the conflict, displacement, and killing. Bloody conflicts in Syria, Somalia, and other places have not received the wide-reaching international media coverage—or urgent international government action—that the invasion of Ukraine has inspired. This is not surprising. We simply have to look to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and which groups of people, communities, and countries have had equitable access to testing, treatment, and vaccination. Much like how the history of African enslavement in the United States still haunts our country in many ways, the legacy of African colonization in Europe is still surfacing, even amid a war that threatens the very existence of an entire country.

As the United States and the world offer their support to Ukraine in their fight for freedom, we cannot abandon the equitable deployment of civil and human rights. All people, regardless of race or nationality, must be equally allowed access to cross borders to safety. As we pray and hope for an end to the Russian invasion, I hope we realize there is much work to do during peacetime to ensure that everyone has equitable access to the same civil rights and dignity during conflict. We should care about the humanity and lives of people regardless of their race, ethnic origin, nationality, education, or social class background.","March 3, 2022",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
69,"Taxation, Representation, and Climate Migration",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/taxation-representation-and-climate-migration/,"Vanessa Williamson, Ellis Chen","Man-made climate change is already provoking mass migration. As environmental conditions worsen, that trend will accelerate. Within the United States, large regions that are currently heavily populated will become increasingly difficult to live in, and tens of millions of Americans will respond by moving.

After reviewing what we know about climate migration, we turn to the fiscal and electoral implications of that migration within the United States. Political inertia is the primary barrier to climate action—not a lack of scientific data, technological prowess, or national resources. So it is vital to understand how climate change, including climate migration, will alter our political system. At the core of the political system are representation and taxation: the process by which political decision-makers are chosen and the process by which political decisions are funded.

The paper is divided into three parts, examining the electoral and fiscal issues for places losing population due to climate change, places experiencing population instability, and places gaining population. In each of these scenarios, under current conditions, climate migration will likely exacerbate racial and class disparities of wealth and political power. The paper concludes by proposing a research and policy development agenda to better equip the policymakers that will be responding to climate migration.

Predictions regarding climate migration are highly tentative, but the best estimates suggest that, globally, climate stressors will lead  over 100 million people to move, often within their own countries, over the next 75 years.1 As Abrahm Lustgarten has documented in his book “On the Move,” tens of millions of Americans will likely be among the displaced. In fact, the First Street Foundation, which models climate risk, has calculated that climate change-related flood risk has already reduced the U.S. population of the highest-risk areas by 3.2 million.

Climate stresses are being felt in all regions of the country, but some areas are particularly vulnerable. The Southwest is experiencing extreme heat and serious water shortages, and those problems will worsen. Millions of Americans living on the coasts have homes at risk of inundation by sea level rise. Climate change is reducing crop yields, encouraging out-migration from America’s farmlands. The expanding range, frequency, and severity of wildfires, floods, and hurricanes will drive even more Americans from their homes.

One challenge of modeling climate migration patterns is that current trends are not a clear predictor of future behavior. Recent decades have seen relatively low levels of interstate mobility and population booms in places at very high risk of climate disaster. Sun Belt cities are growing faster than cities in other regions. There is, however, some evidence that residential patterns are changing as people consider the risks of climate change in their housing choices, a trend that will accelerate as home insurance becomes increasingly unaffordable or unavailable in high-risk areas. When tipping points occur, neighborhood home values will likely experience cascade effects.2

Broadly speaking, climate change is expected to push the U.S. population inland, northward, into cities, and uphill. This is not to suggest most people will abruptly move thousands of miles; most people who move, including those moving in the wake of disaster, go to neighboring communities or nearby states. Climate change will also redistribute populations within localities, particularly in areas where flooding is an increasing risk. Moreover, the movement of people will not be uniform. There will be both gradual movement in response to background conditions like increasing heat, and sudden evacuations in response to specific disasters, like hurricanes.3

Studies of previous migrations provide some suggestions about who, faced by ecological disaster, is most likely to move. Among the most mobile are people with fewer ties to the local community: young people and renters. People with greater educational attainment also tend to move more. The elderly and homeowners are more likely to stay (or, in the case of sudden and extreme disasters, more likely to return and rebuild). There is also a partisan divide in exposure to climate risk; Republicans are more inclined to own properties threatened by sea level rise—an apparent consequence of longstanding denial of climate change within the Republican Party.4

Wealth both makes it easier to move and easier to remain. Marginalized communities are more likely to live in places exposed to climate pollution and vulnerable to climate disasters but face added difficulties in moving away from or evacuating affected areas. They are also less likely to receive adequate assistance in the aftermath of disaster and are more likely to face difficulties in returning home after evacuation. Climate disasters have therefore exacerbated economic inequality.5

As the effects of climate change intensify, some areas of the United States will see their population go into secular decline. Where the climate is becoming especially inhospitable, it is poorer and less urban areas that are most immediately vulnerable to population erosion. Metropolitan areas are more economically vibrant than rural areas, and wealth increases the capacity to fund climate-mitigating infrastructure. Rural areas are also especially dependent on reliable weather; agriculture is, of course, on the front line of climate change.

In some cases, depopulation is occurring in an organized fashion, through what is known as “managed retreat”: the coordinated movement of a community to a new location. Coastal Louisiana’s Isle de Jean Charles was in the process of eroding into the Gulf of Mexico when the community, with a grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, resettled on higher ground. In 2023, the Jean Charles Choctaw Nation, whose homeland was on Isle de Jean Charles, filed a complaint alleging that Louisiana’s Office of Community Development violated their civil rights by excluding tribal leaders from decision-making surrounding the retreat after funding had been allocated.6

The case of Isle de Jean Charles indicates the vital need for community-directed decision-making in response to climate change—a need no less significant in places where population decline will occur less systematically, through gradual attrition, sudden evacuations, or a combination of the two.

Ensuring the civic rights and self-determination of communities seeing depopulation is especially challenging because those areas will see declining wealth and declining representation. Depopulating areas will experience reduced electoral representation, both within states and nationally, as districts are reapportioned. The political implications of these changes will undoubtedly be quite substantial. Florida has seen its delegation in the House of Representatives grow by about 90% from 15 members in 1980 to 28 today; Michigan, by contrast, lost more than a quarter of its House seats over the same period. It is plausible to imagine climate change reversing, or more than reversing, this shift in apportionment over the decades to come.

Apportionment of the U.S. Senate will not be altered by population shifts, of course. To the extent that climate out-migration occurs in rural states more than urban ones, it would increase the Senate’s rural bias. But it is not obvious whether climate migration will make the Senate more or less representative of the nation as a whole; states particularly exposed to climate stressors include many of the most-populous states (e.g. Florida, Texas, and California) and many of the smallest states (e.g. Delaware, Rhode Island, and Hawaii).

Localities with a declining population may also see substantial change in their partisan balance. These places will likely have a poorer remaining population, both because people with resources will leave and because the local economy will decline. How rising poverty will affect voting patterns is unclear. Democrats have an advantage among lower and lower-middle income voters, but American partisanship is also split along racial and educational lines; white voters without a college degree support the Republican Party about 2-to-1 over the Democratic Party, while three-fifths of Hispanic and over four-fifths of Black voters without college degrees are Democrats. Places experiencing population decline will also likely have an aging population, which usually skews more conservative.

Whatever their partisanship, depopulating areas will see very serious fiscal challenges. The tax base will decline due to falling property values and a shrinking working-age population.7 These localities will find it harder to borrow but will need additional infrastructure investments to offset the physical damage of disasters and additional services for an older and poorer population coping with an increasingly harsh physical environment. In short, these communities will have more needs but less money to address those needs.

Failure to support people in depopulating places presents a serious risk to political stability and democratic practices. Places experiencing emigration see a rise in support for radical right parties, in part because the remaining voters tend to be more conservative, but also because of reactions to the economic decline associated with population loss. Cuts to public services and housing foreclosure increase support for the far right.

The political challenges facing depopulating areas are exacerbated by the U.S. tax system, under which local governments are responsible for many public investments and are heavily reliant on property taxes. Places with declining population will see declining home values, undermining the capacity of locales to provide for their remaining citizens. State and national intervention will be necessary to ensure the availability of public services in areas seeing climate out-migration. In addition, as the economy declines, those who remain will require greater protections for their personal welfare. Strengthening federal social insurance protections for the elderly poor is an important component of protecting the people living in depopulating places.

Many places will see population instability in the face of climate change. Most obviously, there will be places that see abrupt population declines in the immediate aftermath of disasters; in the months and years that follow, it will not be clear what fraction of the former population will return. We may also see a rise in seasonal residence patterns, in response to part-year dangers like extreme heat and seasonal storms. As we destabilize the climate system, some places thought to be climate refuges will themselves become disaster areas. Hurricanes, for example, are often perceived as a coastal risk, but 2024’s Hurricane Helene devastated a large swathe of inland North Carolina.

Cities in increasingly inhospitable climates are especially likely to experience instability, as they both bear the brunt of climate change and receive population from high-risk areas. One consequence can be climate gentrification. In Miami, for example, developers of expensive properties have increasingly sought to build in higher elevation areas, raising prices in historically lower-income neighborhoods.8

Population instability will have substantial consequences for both taxation and representation. It is difficult to administer an inclusive, voter-friendly election when it is held during or soon after a major disaster—particularly because disasters are especially destabilizing for people from marginalized communities. When people move, they become less likely to vote, both because they must re-register and because they often lose social ties that encourage participation. The effect can linger for years.9 Disasters make it harder for voters to make it to the polls and differentially disenfranchise marginalized communities.

The short-term effects of disasters on turnout can be mitigated, recent research has shown. It is important to diversify election access by permitting early and absentee voting and publicizing these options ahead of time. Consolidating and changing voting places should be avoided as much as possible. Local elections administrators can create “Continuity of Operations Plans” when preparing for potential disruptions, which reduces pressures on election administrators to create plans after disasters happen. For example, a plan might describe how election officials would proceed in the event of flood damage to voting machines. FEMA also provides emergency management training, which can also help provide training and guidance to election officials in the event of a disaster.

Over a longer time period, however, climate gentrification can fundamentally alter the politics of a city. In New Orleans, the composition of the voting public changed after Hurricane Katrina; though the city’s total population eventually rebounded, there were substantial declines in the share of population that is Black. In 2007, two years after the hurricane, the city had a majority-white City Council for the first time in decades.

Ensuring that communities can rebuild sustainably, without pricing marginalized communities out of their homes, is one of the most serious challenges of climate change in population-unstable locations. One piece of the solution is a reconsideration of the role of the property tax in local government funding systems. The local fiscal effects of disasters are mitigated, but not eliminated, by federal disaster aid, welfare spending, and private insurance payouts. Rebuilding spurs economic activity and temporarily increases sales tax revenue—and politicians reap a political reward for this recovery.10 But these investments do not resolve the fundamental inequities built into the American housing and property tax system11—inequities that will be exacerbated by climate change.

Already, poorer communities struggle to raise revenue; their challenges will multiply as climate pressure grows. Major hurricanes reduce local revenues, resulting in a decline in public spending, deficits, and lower municipal bond ratings. After a hurricane, municipalities see interest rates on debt that are 1% higher. These revenue challenges will only grow more severe over time. Exposure to future sea level rise raises the costs of long-term municipal borrowing, and disasters have cumulative negative fiscal effects. These fiscal problems are even more serious in communities with large populations of poor or non-white people.

The need for property tax revenue also encourages governments to greenlight unsafe development for wealthy residents. “The fiscalization of land use,” as urban planners Linda Shi and Andrew M. Varuzzo put it, “has driven and is driving cities to continue building on the waterfront, despite clear evidence that this is a bad idea in the long-term.” There is, they note, an “underlying tension between land-based local government finance and climate change adaptation.” There is equally a tension between our current property tax system and climate justice.

Places less exposed to climate disasters will see their population increase in the years to come. The political character of these communities will be altered, both by the dislocations associated with mass immigration and by the political character of the new arrivals.

Rapid in-migration can result in shortages of essential goods, especially housing, and higher demand for public services. It is plausible that some communities will see both increased need for social assistance, due to the arrival of poorer immigrants, and immigration-induced gentrification, as wealthier incomers price out longstanding residents. But a growing population, and the relocation of industry, can also bring revitalization. Despite political rhetoric to the contrary, most studies find that immigration does not have a long-term negative impact on aggregate wages or unemployment. Places receiving climate migrants in Texas and Florida have not seen rising unemployment rates.

Communities receiving large numbers of climate migrants will experience substantial political change. For one, a large population inflow can markedly change the political composition of a community. Domestic migrants often bring their politics with them to a new part of the country, though they also tend to pick places to live that are politically congruent with their views.12

It will take time, however, for migrant Americans to find their political voice. Because of the dislocation and loss of social ties caused by migration, it can be challenging for even internal migrants to involve themselves in the local politics of their adoptive homes. There is some evidence that politicians are less inclined to represent the interests of internal migrants. An important consideration for communities with population instability is to build local institutions that encourage political and social incorporation. An easy first step is to reduce the red-tape barriers to voting by making registration automatic and portable.

This need for social and political incorporation is reinforced by the other political effect of in-migration: the response of longtime residents. People often react to immigration from abroad by supporting xenophobic parties and opposing economic redistribution. Individuals’ opposition to immigration is not well-explained by personal economic considerations, like the risk of losing one’s job to an immigrant. Instead, ethnic prejudice and fear of cultural change are at the heart of anti-immigrant sentiment; concerns about the economy play a secondary role.

Similar dynamics have been found in the response to domestic migration. In the United States, evidence from the Great Migration, Hurricane Katrina, public housing demolition, and even an experiment conducted at train stations suggests that white Americans tend to develop more exclusionary attitudes when people of a different race or ethnicity move near them. There is therefore a serious risk that communities receiving domestic migrants will react with hostility, especially when those newcomers are of a different race or ethnicity or if migrants are perceived as a drain on local resources.

There is a growing literature on how local communities can build the institutional capacity necessary to successfully incorporate migrants.13 International immigrant resettlement in Europe also provides some insight into how funding from state and central governments can help communities foster meaningful and positive contact between migrants and natives and reduce anti-migrant attitudes.14 Funding from the federal government could also incentivize a wider array of communities to welcome migrants, another strategy that effectively reduces the likelihood of backlash.

Political leaders will play a key role in either fomenting or mitigating anti-migrant sentiment. As political scientist Daniel Hopkins has noted, “hostile political reactions to neighboring immigrants are most likely when communities undergo sudden influxes of immigrants and when salient national rhetoric reinforces the threat.” But if political leaders can activate their constituents’ prejudices, they can also reduce hostility to immigrants through their rhetoric, their policy decisions, and their political coalition-building.

During the early and mid-20th century, six million Black Americans moved out of the South. Despite the backlash this migration engendered, the Great Migration increased support for civil rights among white Americans. In the northern and western cities, Black Americans became a crucial urban voting bloc and a critical portion of the industrial workforce. Eventually, they achieved an extraordinary political feat: turning the Democratic Party, the party of “Jim Crow” segregation, into the party of civil rights. As we think about climate migration, there is much to learn from the process of political realignment that occurred in the northern Democratic parties and in the union movement.","January 21, 2025",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
70,The banality of racism in education,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-banality-of-racism-in-education/,Jon Valant,"A few years ago, I ran a study with a colleague, Daniel Newark, of how Americans think about test score gaps in education. It featured a survey experiment with a nationally representative sample of adults. The study design let us test for differences in how Americans see Black-white, Hispanic-white, and wealthy-poor gaps. The study’s main finding was that Americans are far more concerned about, and willing to address, wealth-based gaps than race- and ethnicity-based gaps.

The finding that has stuck with me the most, though, came from a question about how people explain the gaps that exist today. We asked, “How much of the difference in test scores between white students and Black students can be explained by discrimination against Blacks or injustices in society?” Nearly half (44%) of respondents chose “None.” Only 10% chose “A great deal.”

That 44% figure still feels stunning, and plainly wrong—especially in the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing. We are a country only a century-and-a-half removed from the enslavement of African Americans and its accompanying anti-literacy laws, which prohibited teaching slaves to read and write. The end of that era led not to some type of egalitarian or meritocratic society—or any sincere, sustained attempt to get there—but rather to the Jim Crow laws and de jure segregation of yesterday and the de facto segregation and structural racism of today. We are not a country in which current disparities just reflect how hard different groups of people are trying. Yet respondents to our survey were far more inclined to attribute gaps to perceived deficiencies in Black parenting and student motivation than to these profound inequities.

I don’t know exactly what attitudes and experiences led to those responses. Undoubtedly, many reflect individual prejudices and failures of empathy. But I also worry that the manifestations of structural racism have become such a fixed, omnipresent part of the educational landscape that it is hard for many of us to see them.

Some of those manifestations are not explicitly in education policy or practice, but they affect students nonetheless. There are exclusionary zoning policies that keep families that can’t afford single-family homes out of high-performing school districts; tax policies that prevent Black wealth accumulation (and corresponding spending on educational resources); and mass-incarceration practices that remove parents from children’s homes and strain those left behind.

Other manifestations are direct matters of education policy and practice. Some are subtle decisions that happen largely out of sight, day after day, like missed opportunities to assign students of color to advanced coursework and excessive discipline practices that send misguided messages. Others are there for us to see: funding levels that leave many high-poverty schools inadequately resourced; attendance boundaries that erect barriers to desirable schools; and test-based accountability measures that stack the deck against high-poverty schools by emphasizing student proficiency over growth.

If there’s a silver lining for education in the simultaneous crises of COVID-19 and police brutality, maybe it’s an increased public willingness—however fleeting—to take a closer look at our education systems and the countless inequities they inherit, reproduce, and create. Of course, not everyone will want to look. Some will, though, and perhaps they will see just how defining those inequities are and what we could do about them.

Part of the responsibility for clearer vision lies with the education community, which must speak clearly and honestly about the depth and causes of educational inequity. A growing chorus of scholars—including Gloria Ladson-Billings, Prudence Carter, and Kevin Welner—argues that we have done a poor job of conceptualizing and communicating about inequities. In particular, the term “achievement gap,” while useful in increasing public recognition of a problem, connotes a failure of low-scoring students (who do not or cannot “achieve”) rather than a societal failure in creating the opportunity gaps that produce those scores. An interesting new paper by David Quinn shows that an “achievement gap” framing can, though does not always, lead people to underestimate Black students’ performance—a topic that warrants further study.

Neither the COVID-19 outbreak nor the national outcry over police brutality is, at its core, an education story. But the issues surfaced by those crises are familiar. Education rarely has a lurid moment—what political scientists call a “focusing event”—that, while horrific, can draw attention to an issue and mobilize action. When we do, like the Parkland shooting, it seldom points directly at issues of race and inequality. Rather, moments of educational inequity happen quietly, day after day, in places like classrooms and school-board meeting rooms, often at the hands of people who mean no harm.

In many ways, it’s this banality that feels so dangerous. It’s that so much of the problem lies in plain sight and still can be so difficult for many of us to see. Hopefully the circumstances of the moment will help us see those problems, and their solutions, more clearly.","June 4, 2020",Brookings Institution,race prejudice

72,Why we need to enhance STEM education for rural girls in Bangladesh,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-we-need-to-enhance-stem-education-for-rural-girls-in-bangladesh/,Nasrin Siddiqa,"The garment industry transformed the Bangladesh economy and women’s lives—it increased their economic empowerment. But women are not leading the industry despite making up more than 90 percent of the workforce.

One explanation is that women lack the technical and digital skills to lead innovation in the sector, as well as the capacity to overcome structural barriers like violence, discrimination, exploitation, and physical and mental harassment.

Automation further compounds the challenges women face in the garment industry. Girls and women must catch up to the new realities of automation to ensure they evolve with the jobs of the future. But it’s not just the garment industry in Bangladesh that needs a female workforce educated in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)—we need more STEM teachers, agricultural leaders, scientists, mathematicians, and engineers as industries evolve.

More female students attend school today in Bangladesh than ever before, but the overall quality of education is poor, and rural schools are heavily under-resourced. Numerous factors, like lack of support from family and society,  lack of good teachers, violence, child marriage, and prejudice against the rural community—among other factors—affect rural girls’ education. This is even more so the case concerning their participation in STEM subjects, and consequently, in STEM careers: South and West Asia have the lowest proportion of women in STEM in the world, and Bangladesh is at the very bottom with only 14 percent involved in STEM.

To ensure a sustainable future for Bangladesh, the country needs to consider STEM as an important catalyst. As I’ve said in previous op-eds, “We need more scientists and innovators and only proper STEM education can hold the key [to] this success.” We must strengthen girls’ education in STEM subjects, as it will not only help increase their meaningful participation in STEM activities, but also help change the exploitative conditions in STEM-related industries, like garment-making, where they work. Women’s participation in STEM fields can bring economic progress for them and their families, fueling growth of the Bangladesh economy.

In the past 20 years of my professional life, I have been working to promote quality education, STEM fields, girls’ education and rights, and women’s empowerment. While many people think girls aren’t interested in STEM, I beg to differ.  The organization I founded, Education and Cultural Society (ECS), has formed 30 STEM clubs in different educational institutions across Bangladesh with hundreds of girls eager to participate. We have organized many STEM innovation fairs and a conference. But we must work more rigorously for sustainable solutions and to bridge grassroots efforts like mine with infrastructure changes at the policy level.

Because this issue is so urgent, I came to Brookings as an Echidna Global Scholar to highlight the need to lift up girls in Bangladesh through STEM. During my time at Brookings, my research will identify the challenges rural girls experience in accessing STEM education in Bangladesh, as well as some concrete solutions  to empower rural girls, enhance awareness among policymakers to improve and provide equal access to STEM education and career opportunities, and spread STEM knowledge across all sectors of society.

After returning home from this program, I want to make long-lasting impact by equipping female workers with the necessary technical and digital skills to become leaders in the Bangladesh workforce.","July 1, 2019",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
73,"A new assault on a democratic citadel in Turkey, too",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-new-assault-on-a-democratic-citadel-in-turkey-too/,"Ayşe Candan Kirişci, Kemal Kirişci","Just a week before the Jan. 6 mob attack on America’s citadel of democracy, the U.S. Capitol, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan waged a different kind of assault on one of his country’s last bastions of democratic thought, Boğaziçi University in Istanbul. Both events provide the latest evidence of how partisan politics and poisonous rhetoric, as championed by Erdoğan and President Donald Trump, can shake the pillars of a democratic society.

Erdoğan’s move against Boğaziçi – installing his own rector at a renowned and once-independent university — sparked instant reaction, apparently much wider in scope and tone than the government anticipated. It has prompted protests led by students and joined by the faculty at Boğaziçi that continue today, along with vigorous opposition on social media, in opinion pieces, and via petition campaigns at home and abroad. The situation risks sparking yet another faceoff between the secular, democratically oriented segment of Turkish society and a populist, authoritarian president who has grown increasingly intolerant of any demand that checks his power and seeks accountability.

Boğaziçi, where classes are taught entirely in English, is one of the best universities in Turkey and has a historic link with the United States. (Both of us earned degrees there, and one of us, Kemal, was a professor there for 24 years.) It rates in the top 200 on a list of 1,500 top universities worldwide in U.S. News & World Report’s ranking of Best Global Universities. The school was founded in 1863 as Robert College through the tireless efforts of a versatile educator from New England, Cyrus Hamlin, who also happened to be the brother of Hannibal Hamlin, Abraham Lincoln’s vice president.

Istanbul was then known as the Ottoman capital Constantinople, long before the Turkish republic came into being, and a civil war was raging in the United States, itself a fledgling republic. Despite the school’s origins in seminary work, this new institution made a point of opening “its doors to students of all races, nationalities and religions without prejudice or discrimination.”

Robert College eventually was incorporated into the Turkish higher education network and renamed Boğaziçi in 1971, as students at American universities at home and abroad were protesting the Vietnam War and their Turkish counterparts were grappling with ideological clashes on their own campuses. Boğaziçi was home to students holding diverse political views; it stood out for its ability to provide an atmosphere where political divides did not lead to the kind of violent confrontations that inflamed many other universities of the time.

Similarly to Ronald Reagan’s boast that the United States is a ‘shining city on the hill,’ Boğaziçi has long been a shining light from the hills above the Bosporus Strait, the famed waterway dividing Asia from Europe. The university has traditionally represented Turkey’s western orientation, sought to educate young minds attuned to democratic principles and capable of critical thinking. It provides tuition-free education to a diverse body of students selected on merit alone. Any high school graduate, irrespective of religion, economic, or social background, can become a student at Boğaziçi if they receive the highest scores on a grueling entrance exam taken by close to 2.5 million young people every year.","January 15, 2021",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
74,"5 questions policymakers should ask about facial recognition, law enforcement, and algorithmic bias",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/5-questions-policymakers-should-ask-about-facial-recognition-law-enforcement-and-algorithmic-bias/,Rashawn Ray,"In the futuristic 2002 film “Minority Report,” law enforcement uses a predictive technology that includes artificial intelligence (AI) for risk assessments to arrest possible murderers before they commit crimes. However, a police officer is now one of the accused future murderers and is on the run from the Department of Justice to prove that the technology has flaws. If you think this fictional film could become true, then you should keep reading—because art has become reality.

Both the promise and peril of emerging technologies are upon us. For law enforcement, AI offers advancements over previously used methods to deter and solve crime, improve efficiency, reduce racial disparities, and potentially save resources related to human and financial capital. Currently, some of the law enforcement technologies that use machine learning algorithms include smart street lights, hot spot policing, facial recognition, drone surveillance, geofencing, risk assessments, and social media data to stop gang violence. Massachusetts State Police are now deploying robotic dogs in the field, raising comparisons to the dystopian 1987 film “RoboCop.” The functions of law enforcement and technology are also rapidly changing. In 2017, I conducted a study that showed substantial support from civilians and police officers for body-worn cameras being an alleged panacea to improve police-community relations. Now, AI can supposedly determine who will commit crime, predict where crime will occur, and identify potential threats—all of which amplifies its perceived viability related to body-worn cameras.

Tech companies already are creating commercial AI products with little oversight or regulation. Furthermore, they often solicit law enforcement agencies to participate in pilot studies and test trials in exchange for usage of the new technology. Since many law enforcement agencies are strapped financially, the opportunity to try a shiny new toy is enticing. The United Kingdom deployed a passport-recognition software despite knowing that it did not work well on people with darker and lighter skin tones. However, this is not just happening in Europe. As this paper demonstrates, the U.S. is riddled with these issues. In trying to compete with China, India, and other countries on criminal justice technology, the U.S. is compromising peak performance and potentially putting all Americans at risk.

“In trying to compete with … other countries on criminal justice technology, the U.S. is compromising peak performance and potentially putting all Americans at risk.”

But policymakers can intervene in constructive ways. There are meaningful safeguards that need to be put in place in order to protect people. It also could be argued that the potential for AI to determine who will be arrested by law enforcement, incarcerated, and released from prison are at the top of the list regarding the need to be cautious. What do policymakers need to know about AI deployment in law enforcement, and what are the central questions to ask as regulations and safeguards are implemented?

One main public concern around law enforcement use of AI and other emerging technologies is in the area of facial recognition. As of 2016, over half of the faces of American adults were part of facial recognition databases accessible to law enforcement. Yet, not everyone is worried about this deployment. Over 50% of people trust police’s use of facial recognition, and nearly 75% believe that facial recognition accurately identifies people. There are, however, important demographic differences. About 60% of white respondents compared to slightly over 40% of Black respondents trust police’s use of facial recognition. Age shows a similar gradient, but not in the expected direction. People under 30, compared to people over 65, are less trusting of the use of facial recognition in policing. Young adults’ skepticism may be because they have more knowledge about the capabilities of AI to manipulate actual video footage and alter what the person is saying and doing.

Here is the big conundrum though: Only 36% of adults believe that facial recognition is being used responsibly by private companies, which are often selling facial recognition systems to law enforcement.

Though public opinion is split on the use of facial recognition for policing, research indicates that facial recognition suffers from algorithmic bias. The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) released a paper showing that facial recognition resulted in lower accuracy rates for women compared to men, and for Black individuals relative to white individuals. One study showed that Black women’s gender was misclassified over 33% of the time. In 2019, Amazon’s facial recognition software, Rekognition, incorrectly labeled professional athletes in Boston as criminals. The software also incorrectly labeled one in five California lawmakers as criminals. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) manipulated blurry images with actors like Woody Harrelson to gain more clarity on potential suspects in surveillance footage.

For these and other reasons, San Francisco has banned facial recognition usage by police; Oakland and parts of Massachusetts soon followed suit. Conversely, cities like Detroit and Chicago have used facial recognition software with little oversight for the past few years. New regulations enacted in Detroit in 2019 restrict the use of facial recognition to still photographs related to violent crimes and home invasions. Though law enforcement in the city is applauding the ability to continue using facial recognition, members of the civilian oversight committee claim that the technology is a form of “techno-racism” in a predominately Black city that has a history of police brutality and problematic police-community relations. One key concern is the critique that law enforcement is using unreliable technology that misclassifies city residents, as mentioned previously.

“While it is important that law enforcement have the opportunity to experiment with new technologies, AI should not help make decisions in criminal cases until the technology improves its accuracy.”

While it is important that law enforcement have the opportunity to experiment with new technologies, AI should not help make decisions in criminal cases until the technology improves its accuracy. There should be a moratorium on full-scale implementation to analyze the data from pilot studies (potentially with analysis conducted by a third party, such as a university research center or firm) to evaluate policing outcomes using existing methods to those of using AI.

In addition to facial recognition, there are other forms of AI deployment that policymakers should be mindful about. In the pursuit to be the first true smart city, San Diego deployed smart street lights in 2016. Pitched as a way to reduce energy consumption, the sensors on smart street lights are being used by law enforcement to monitor pedestrian, vehicle, and parking traffic, record video of the area, and solve crimes. For many city residents, the lights are not the issue. Rather, the deployment of the lights by police without the consent of the public is the larger problem. Three city council members asked for a moratorium on using the lights.

San Diego is also in the process of deploying a military-grade drone over the city in 2020 that has the potential to conduct surveillance and gather intelligence similar to the reconnaissance capabilities of the armed forces. In 2018, Rutherford County, Tennessee, became the first in the country to obtain federal approval to fly drones over people. City employees say that Rutherford County can use drones to combat a landfill crisis, assess storm damage, watch the crowd at a white nationalist rally, and track fugitives. On the East Coast, NYPD has used drones at a series of marches and parades, including the Pride March and Puerto Rican Day Parade. In this regard, the sci-fi show “Black Mirror” may become predictive—its “Hated in the Nation” episode featured advanced facial recognition and swarms of tiny, drone-like bees with lethal capabilities.","February 20, 2020",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
75,What everyone is missing about the immigration debate,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-everyone-is-missing-about-the-immigration-debate/,Audrey Singer,"Addressing a group of 31 immigrants from 25 countries at a naturalization ceremony on Tuesday, President Obama spoke of the long history of immigration to the United States and the diversity of experiences of the nation’s new arrivals.

“One generation passes, two generation passes, and suddenly we don’t remember where we came from. And we suggest that somehow there is ‘us’ and there is ‘them,’ not remembering we used to be ‘them,’” he said.

As presidential candidates talk of barring Muslims from entering and shutting down our refugee program, it’s worth thinking about how “we” are new arrivals one day, but forget our origins the next. It’s a process some call integration and others call assimilation.

Integration takes place across both an individual immigrant or refugee’s life and across generations. The National Academies of Sciences (NAS), a nonprofit institution, released a new report on immigrant integration that helps to define and measure the process that President Obama called out, noting that integration happens because immigrants change when they arrive in the United States, and because native-born Americans change in response to immigrants.

Like it or not, integration has been happening over America’s 239-year history, as members of both groups—immigrants and the U.S.-born—continually come to resemble one another. And America has benefited greatly from the economic vitality and cultural vibrancy that immigrants and their descendants have brought and continue to contribute.

While 13% of the U.S. population is born outside of the United States, if you include their U.S.-born children, one in four residents are part of first or second immigrant generations. As a result, intermarriage rates between immigrants and natives—and between those of different races and ethnicity—have risen to one out of every seven marriages. More than half of recent marriages involving immigrants included a native-born partner, and their children are more likely to be identified as multiracial as a result, rising from 1% to 10% between 1970 and today, among infants.

What’s more, 35% of Americans say that one of their close kin is of a different race, according to a Pew Research Center survey. Together, these trends describe how social and cultural boundaries are diminishing as immigrants and natives literally come to resemble one another.

But even amongst these overall patterns, immigrants arrive with very different backgrounds in terms of language, education, skills, occupation, religion, family support, age at arrival, gender, and outlook. Some are fleeing war or persecution, others have job offers, some are joining family members already in the United States, and still others start and grow families here. All of these factors position immigrant newcomers and the next generations at different starting points, which affects how quickly and how well they enter into the social, economic, and political mainstream.

Certain obstacles—in particular, legal status and race—impede the integration process. The NAS study highlighted these concerns—they’re not only a problem for the first generation, but also for the second generation, who are, by definition, U.S. citizens. More than 5 million children live in households with at least one parent who does not have legal status. The majority of those children are U.S.-born, but an estimated three-quarters of a million immigrants are undocumented themselves. Lack of legal status limits access to healthcare and social services, higher education, jobs, and earnings. Moreover, black immigrant newcomers, and their children, in particular, inherit a significant barrier to integration due to discrimination, as compared with their nonblack counterparts. Other nonwhite immigrants also struggle with the kind of prejudice that comes with entering a racially stratified society.

Where immigrants settle matters, too, because integration is an inherently local experience. Where they live—across different states and within metropolitan areas, cities, suburbs, rural areas, and neighborhoods—represents an environment of reception that ultimately determines access to good schools, safe neighborhoods, and good jobs.

It is fair to say that the vast majority of immigrants enter the United States with the hope of more opportunities and a promising future for the next generation. This has been the irresistible attraction to this country for generations, and their drive and contributions are what we need to keep in mind before being so quick to turn away those simply seeking a better life.","December 20, 2015",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
76,Political ideas in the 21st century,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/political-ideas-in-the-21st-century/,Charles King,"In 1950, the editors at Foreign Affairs asked the political theorist Isaiah Berlin to take the long view of his own moment. As a former child refugee from the Bolsheviks, biographer of Marx, and Jewish witness to the rise of Nazism, as well as the casual prejudices of an Oxford common room, Berlin knew firsthand the consequences of ideas in the world.

His take, however, was unconventional. Rather than a world cloven into capitalist and communist parts, or a sphere of freedom and one of unfreedom, or places that prized individual liberty versus order and obedience, Berlin saw the dominant “political ideas in the twentieth century,” as his essay was called, entirely differently. The great divide was not between left and right but between certainty and skepticism.

The struggle of his own time, Berlin believed, was how to protect the creative power of doubt in a world replete with ready-made answers to the great problems of human existence. The extremes of left and right shared an assumption that the ultimate ends of political life were beyond serious debate. “What the age calls for is not (as we are so often told) more faith or stronger leadership or more rational organization,” Berlin concluded. “Rather is it the opposite: less Messianic ardor, more enlightened skepticism, more toleration of idiosyncrasies, more frequent ad hoc and ephemeral arrangements, more room for the attainment of their personal ends by individuals and by minorities whose tastes and beliefs find (whether rightly or wrongly must not matter) little response among the majority.” Surviving the century, Berlin believed, would require less conviction and more conversation.

As a writer and, even more, a voracious talker, Berlin was interested in how people make sense of history in a given place and time—how dominant worldviews, available metaphors, and local common sense shape the way people understand reality. For Berlin, the 19th century had been characterized by broad optimism that the great problems of human society—how best to organize government, how to alleviate want, how to secure peace—were solvable with the right application of reason and virtue. Government and international affairs were thought of as a kind of science, one that offered better and worse solutions based on experience and a proper view of what had worked in the past and what had failed.

Berlin’s own century was different, he felt. The worldviews of communism and fascism entailed not so much alternative solutions as a claim that political and moral problems were not problems at all. Once class conflict disappeared or the racial state was purified, everything else would be reduced to technical questions of efficiency and polishing. What the world needed in 1950 was a defense of the right to be wrong, to be genuinely different, to make a mistake, to try again.

Berlin’s midcentury stocktaking was standard among a certain subset of European intellectuals. For all their differences, writers such as Friedrich Hayek, Karl Popper, and Hannah Arendt saw the deepest canyon in politics as running between pluralists and anti-pluralists. They were, at base, liberals trying to make sense of the rise of two different kinds of European illiberalism in their own time: Stalin’s and Hitler’s. The priorities of a liberal outlook—individuals over groups, people over states, freedom over conformity, rules over fiat—had been brutally overturned by twin tyrannies in the first half of the century. The societies that emerged afterward—the welfare states of Western Europe, the integrated European Union, even the United States as something approaching a multiracial democracy after 1965—were backstops against the same thing happening again. This “liberalism of fear,” as the political theorist Judith Shklar put it, would remain the dominant way of understanding the threats to the liberal order down to the present.

But to the degree that postwar liberalism triumphed, it came to suffer from its own brand of complacency and self-satisfaction. As Tony Judt warned in his Aron Lecture at Brookings in 2005, a month after the publication of his monumental book, “Postwar,” “We have lived, most of us in this room, and most Europeans today, for too long in a post-ideological or, if you like, post-political era. We’ve forgotten what it was like before, how fragile the Western consensus of the past few decades could so easily prove.” Tony could foresee the ascendancy of Donald Trump, Viktor Orbán, and Vladimir Putin because he was a student of societies that had produced the same kind of person in the last century. But, unlike Berlin, he came of age in a time that had faith the old demons were more or less exorcised—a faith that he believed was in error. As Tony put it, “[w]e’ve forgotten what ideological politics were like.”

Today, ideological politics has come roaring back. At no point since the 1940s have the contrasting ideas at stake in political debate been so starkly evident. Nor have they been so aligned across the United States and Europe. Like isobars on a meteorologist’s map, the Atlantic is part of a single political weather system. Four years ago, the U.S.-based movement Black Lives Matter energized communities across Europe. Terms such as “anticolonialism” and “indigeneity” are now deployed by both American college students and young people in Ireland, Ukraine, and Georgia. Serious American political theorists and commentators, not just trolls or YouTube bros, make common cause with the European nationalist right, just as Russian intelligence officials seek inroads with the antiracist or anti-Zionist left. And figures such as Nigel Farage or Viktor Orbán regularly speak at Republican conferences—in Orbán’s case, casting Hungary as a version of what a Christian Reconquista might yet achieve in the United States. “The adherents of [the] old world are still sitting there in Brussels, . . . and I am afraid they are sitting there in Washington, too. This year we set out to chase them away, so that the era of sovereignty will finally come,” Orbán told the three thousand attendees at the new CPAC Budapest conference, an offshoot of the principal annual gathering of American conservatives. “Go Donald Trump! Go European sovereigntists!”

So, how are we to make sense of all this? The easy account is to repeat Berlin’s analysis. An entire shelfful of books by contemporary liberal commentators frame their plight much as Berlin did, as defending a plural, ad hoc, imperfect, conservational worldview against twin intolerances—the woke on one side, the Volk on the other. Pluralism seems once again threatened by new forms of self-satisfied certainty, and these challenges allegedly come as much from the progressive left as the radical right, as anyone schooled in the competing phrasebooks of mobilized theory can confirm: Christian nationalism, postliberalism, settler colonialism, intersectionality, white privilege, antiracism, the Great Replacement, identity politics, CRT, DEI, and on and on. These “discontents with liberalism,” Francis Fukuyama has written, “do not have to do with the essence of the doctrine, but rather with the way in which certain sound liberal ideas have been interpreted and pushed to extremes.” Saving liberalism, Fukuyama argues, will require returning it to the moderate, commonsensical middle ground.

But I think this is the wrong way of seeing things for many reasons, only one of which I can focus on today. The habit of defending pluralism as unmarked and apolitical, as a casual, confident neutrality outside the realm of conviction, is ill suited to the new ideological politics that Tony foresaw twenty years ago. Berlin’s pluralism always had the feel of an overstuffed Oxford sofa—comfortable, cozy even, and most enjoyable when occupied by two disagreeing friends. His liberalism, as Berlin scholars have noted, was more of a disposition than a theory, the product in part of a postwar order when liberals had the luxury of thinking that time was most likely on their side.

But that era is not ours. When confronted with a clear set of counterclaims about history, politics, economics, and human nature, most powerfully from the extreme right, from MAGA Republicans to the Alternative for Germany, pluralists need a more robust account of what it is they actually believe. We need a clearer idea of what pluralism is, what alternatives are on offer, and how to energize a specifically liberal pluralist worldview for our own time.

Many of us of a certain age had our formative intellectual experiences in a late-century grand consensus: in the decades marked by what Fukuyama called the “end of history,” the inevitability of globalization, and the European Union as an epoch-defining experiment in transnational governance. So it takes some effort to reacquaint ourselves with what ideological politics inside our own political systems really looks like.

First, we will have to get used to competing vocabularies of politics. If everyone was a liberal of a sort after the Second World War—with freedom, human rights, and “European values” as the stuff of political discourse—agreement about the terms of debate is now gone. The culturally defined nation has returned, as has the family, along with words that we might have thought were banished, such as “purity,” “vermin,” “mass deportation,” and “blood.” These are of course terms now wielded by the far right, but liberals are unused even to debating mainstream conservatives who speak of politics and society in unfamiliar ways. “Virtue” and “civilization,” for example, are part of a conservative discourse that liberals have not had to engage with in any serious way—outside the seminar room—for decades.

Second, ideas live in places, so we will have to get used again to the idea of competing centers of ideological politics. When the economist Walt Rostow laid out the basis for American engagement in the developing world in 1960, in his “Stages of Economic Growth,” there was a reason that he subtitled it “A Non-Communist Manifesto.” He understood that the Soviet Union offered not only a source of arms and materiel but also a specific model of governance and growth. Something similar is happening now—the difference being that the sources of the new ideological politics are not as neatly delineated as during the Cold War. Russia has become one of the producers of ideas about government, greatness, and gender that travel along the darker corridors of the internet. But thinkers, parties, and institutions in the United States, the E.U., and India are part of the mix as well. It is now a toss-up as to whether, in a matter of weeks, the ideas that animate the executive branches of government in the United States and Russia will come closer than ever before. That is not at all what the Soviet physicist and human rights activist Andrei Sakharov had in mind by the term “convergence” in the 1960s, but it is a word that seems even more accurate now than in the past.

Third, we have to think in terms of not only ideas and their purveyors but also the ecosystems that sustain them. Here I mean not just the miasma of social media, televised infotainment, and professional influencers. Eighteenth-century pamphleteering worked in similar ways. It was the Enlightenment, after all, that gave us some of our earliest recorded complaints about what we now call likes and followers. “It fell dead-born from the press,” David Hume famously complained about the publication of his “Treatise of Human Nature” in 1739.

More troubling is that our version of polarized, idea-driven politics operates inside a market of churning consumerism, something perhaps most apparent in the United States. Over the last 30 years, Americans have sorted themselves not so much into political parties, faith communities, or racial and ethnic groups as into communities of consumption. Private and religiously affiliated schools and universities, social media, cable and satellite television, communal entertainment, and even clothing and home décor are now zones of expressive ideology in ways that would have been astonishing a few decades ago. If you’ve not heard of Hillsdale College, or watched a film produced by Angel Studios, or purchased clothing from Cabela’s, or shopped for a scented candle at Altar’d State—all organizations and businesses very familiar to many Christian conservatives in the United States—you live on one side of a vast American divide. At present there is no exact European equivalent of this phenomenon—consuming your ideology until it becomes an identity—but the logic of ideological politics under consumerism has the potential to push everyone in this direction.

A defense of pluralism has always been challenging because one so often finds oneself defending it against people who also claim to be pluralists. Nationalists are perfectly willing to admit that other nationalities exist, just so long as they stay in their lane. Racists make the same rhetorical move. “In united effort we are meant to live under this government . . . each striving from his separate political station, respecting the rights of others to be separate and work from within their political framework,” George Wallace said in 1963, “[b]ut if we amalgamate into the one unit as advocated by the communist philosophers, then the enrichment of our lives, the freedom for our development, is gone forever.”

Even current-day illiberals admit that modern, diverse societies are by definition plural. The issue at stake is what the default setting should be for the states that govern them. As the Israeli philosopher Yoram Hazony has written about the United States, governments will have to “restore Christianity as the normative framework and standard determining public life in every setting in which this aim can be attained, along with suitable carve-outs creating spheres of legitimate non-compliance.” If liberals seek to monopolize the public sphere and privatize conservative values—hanging a Pride Flag outside a government office but making the building off-limits to a Bible study group, for example—then conservatives would simply flip the script. Public life would return to being nationalist and outwardly religious by default, with opt-outs for anyone who wished to dissent. “Not every citizen of America is a Christian, obviously,” said Senator Josh Hawley at the 2024 National Conservatism Conference. “But every citizen is heir to the loves, to the liberties, to the common purpose our Christian tradition gives us.” The same speech, of course, could have been given by rightist politicians from across the E.U.—the difference being that, for some, even the carve-outs would disappear inside a re-nationalized, re-sacralized state.

Defending a liberal pluralism, as opposed to this conservative version, should not be hard, even if liberals have gotten out of the practice of doing so explicitly. A defense might include some of the following: A liberal view of pluralist politics doesn’t require that everyone be gay, change their gender, or have an abortion. It simply requires that government be rooted in individual dignity, choice, and voice. Where government fails to live up to these ideals, it should have mechanisms for remedy that are also rooted in individual dignity, choice, and voice. Moreover, the choices that individuals make in these societies are likely to be better—that is, more productive of individual flourishing and general happiness—when people are schooled in developing critical and independent minds. Progress is possible, meaning that the requirements of today and tomorrow have pride of place over the imagined preferences of the dead. History offers no necessities, only nudges. As a result, claims to truth that reside outside real history, for example, in ideas about transhistorical destiny, the hierarchy of one kind of community over others, or the will of God, are less compelling than those that reside in lived human experience.

If liberal pluralists will have to get better at making their case in an era of ideological politics, they will also have to do so in a matrix of memory and history that is very different from that of the recent past. We are now in a moment when the signposts that have guided European and American thinkers and politicians since the mid-twentieth century are passing fully into history. The Second World War, the Holocaust, the Berlin Wall, 1968, 1989—these are no longer the experiences, histories, and symbols that they were for people of Berlin’s generation, or Tony’s, or for that matter mine.

As societies change, so do their metaphors and the lessons they are held to contain. This is natural, but it is also a challenge—especially if liberal pluralists have become more used to wielding metaphors and symbols than ideas. Let me state this plainly: I don’t think Western liberals are yet intellectually prepared for a reality in which the central world-historical and moral event of the twentieth century is no longer remembered as the Holocaust but rather as decolonization. W. E. B. Du Bois framed the problem already in 1925. How would Europe reimagine itself, he wrote, “if Europe became suddenly shadowless,” that is, shorn of the overseas colonies against which European states long defined themselves and their civilization?

The extremes of right and left have already worked out their answers. Good riddance to the shadows, say the nationalists, who have decided that their struggle, too, is a form of decolonization. (“The E.U. must die for the true Europe to live,” declared Björn Höcke, the Alternative for Germany leader in Thuringia.) We are the shadows, say those on the mobilized, multicultural left, and we’re still here. Meanwhile, liberal pluralists chug along with a set of debates, a political vocabulary, and existential worries that have not changed substantially since the end of the Second World War.

One way to start reviving liberal pluralism is to jump back to the 19th century, to a time when liberalism was not triumphant but embattled, with a vitality, in Britain and in continental Europe, that is as invigorating as it is unfamiliar. As the historian and legal scholar Samuel Moyn has argued, we have forgotten the fact that, before it was fearful, liberalism was genuinely liberating. That is why rereading some of the foundational documents of that earlier period—even dusty hymnals such as “On Liberty” by John Stuart Mill, published in 1859—can feel radically refreshing today.

Mill was writing in deep conservation with purveyors of cognate and rival ideas: French liberals and continental socialists of various stripes, as well as his old frenemy, the Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle, who was himself the great interpreter of German romanticism to an English-speaking audience. There was also Mill’s wife, Harriet Taylor, who ought to receive at least equal billing for many of the ideas Mill put forward in “On Liberty” and elsewhere. As Mill himself wrote at the top of “On Liberty,” Taylor was “the inspirer, and in part the author, of all that is best in my writings. Were I but capable of interpreting to the world one half [her] great thoughts and noble feelings . . ., I should be the medium of a greater benefit to it, than is ever likely to arise from anything that I can write, unprompted and unassisted by her all but unrivaled wisdom.” That passage is still the most astonishing dedication any husband has written to his wife—and no doubt the only such thing ever to appear in a classic of Western philosophy.

To Mill and Taylor, no one really knew what the best possible life might look like. For that reason alone, individuals had to be given the freedom to figure out the best way to act and thrive—hence, their famous “experiments of living” phrase in “On Liberty.” That arrangement, in a free society, guaranteed more chances of someone’s coming up with the formula—or at least a formula—for what a good life might be. Morality didn’t come from blindly following custom, nor did it derive from aligning one’s behavior with a given set of virtues, which were, in any case, different from place to place and, in all of them, changeable over time. Instead, in large, modern, diverse societies, the problem of how to live was best understood as a numbers game, with everyone having the scope to work out for themselves what made for a happier world. “[T]he only unfailing and permanent source of improvement is liberty, since by it there are as many possible independent centres of improvement as there are individuals.”

The claim to liberty, Mill and Taylor believed, came not from God’s will or tradition, nor did it rest on disembodied “rights” that humans were said to possess. Rather, a liberal worldview was the natural outgrowth of one of the few things in life we can be absolutely sure of: that we will meet people whose opinions, values, and talents are different from our own. All the problems of morality and governance came down essentially to this encounter, to the question of how to behave with someone very unlike oneself. Everything else was metaphysics.

That was only part of the story, however, and here we come to an unexpected alleyway in Mill and Taylor’s version of liberal pluralism. In a society of free individuals, it was impossible to escape the worry that liberty might descend into anarchy. If I am truly free, after all, what do I possibly owe you? In a world that prizes individual freedom, what are we to do with duty, or obligation, or restraint?

As Mill and Taylor both knew from experience, the one place where this problem had to get worked out was inside a marriage, face to face and every day. In a household, there was simply no place to hide, no solitary retreat where duty disappeared and one was left alone, a pure and denuded individual. A domestic union of equals was the zone that best exemplified the push and pull of individuality and belonging, the deep desire to express one’s selfhood alongside an even deeper commitment to make sure that things didn’t spin out of control. Taylor would ultimately illustrate this in the most astonishing way. For the first two decades of her romantic relationship with Mill, she was still married to someone else. When her husband, John Taylor, fell ill with cancer, Taylor would attend him lovingly until his death. Two years later, she and Mill were finally able to marry.

In practicing duty and obligation inside a family of whatever configuration—and Mill and Taylor’s was a very unconventional one—individuals had an opportunity to work through some of the great questions of modern life: about what outlooks on reality we think of as obvious or normal; about the place of kinship in social order and personal wellbeing; about which behaviors and prejudices we believe are innate and which are amenable to change. In their time together, Mill and Taylor came around to the startling realization that building one’s own life in the fullest freedom and flourishing might even depend on binding it to another’s. As Mill recalled in his autobiography (it, too, a joint effort with Taylor), their marriage had produced “a kind of philosophic text-book of a single truth . . .: the importance, to man and society, of a large variety in types of character, and of giving full freedom to human nature to expand itself in innumerable and conflicting directions.” At their best, Mill and Taylor believed, families change us by encapsulating difference-without-otherness—which also turns out to be one of the foundations of plurality, democracy, and social progress. Healthy politics was simply a scaling up of what made for a thriving home.

I have focused here on Mill and Taylor because they confound the ranking of values that liberal pluralists spend most of their time defending. What Mill and Taylor understood better than anyone in their time was that for all the debates about the size of government, the nature of the market, or even the definition of the nation, the first thing that ought to matter to liberal pluralists is the equality of women and men. The need for an absolute equality of the sexes, Mill later said, was an abstract principle he had felt from childhood. But only through knowing and loving Taylor did it become a viscerally felt conviction—the linchpin, as he saw it, of everything. “[I]t is now the great question of the coming time,” he wrote in the “Autobiography,” “the most urgent interest of human progress, involving the removal of a barrier which now stops the way, and renders all the improvements which can be effected while it remains, slight and superficial.”

Amid debates in Europe and the United States about many other issues—immigration, Ukraine, government spending—we shouldn’t forget how vital that idea remains today. Opposition to real equality between the sexes is the glinting thread that connects the authoritarianism of Putin with the cultural revanchism of Orbán, the Nazi-adjacent nostalgia of the Alternative for Germany with the “manoverse” of Trumpist social media, the “common-good conservatism” of the Catholic right with the Christian nationalism of Protestant evangelicals.

One way for liberal pluralists to recognize this is to recast their own intellectual heritage in a more accurate way, that is, by thinking more capaciously about who gets admitted to the liberal canon and for what reasons. In a phrase, liberal pluralists need to talk more about women. Enlarging the historical conversation is not about “justice” or “regendering” a syllabus, although for progressives those might be goals in themselves. Rather, a broader reading of the origins of liberal pluralism will enrich the vocabulary of political debate and alter the very things that liberals believe are most worth defending.

In the 1790s Mary Wollstonecraft was not just a champion of women’s rights, which is how she is usually taught to undergraduates today. She was also a brilliant theorist of state visibility—the categories of person who were allotted a “civil existence in the state” and those the state simply chose not to see. That very idea would be essential to later conversations about everything from civil rights to accessible building design to marriage equality. In the 1850s Harriet Taylor pushed Mill into seeing that the legal inequality of the sexes rested not only on shaky moral foundations but on shoddy empirical ones as well. As they put it in “The Subjection of Women,” “What is natural to the two sexes can only be found out by allowing both to develop and use their faculties freely.” Human nature, Mill and Taylor taught, can only be glimpsed, if at all, under conditions of equality. That same insight would inform one of the great unsung phenomena of the twentieth century: the shift not only in our moral sense about evils such as racial segregation in the United States or empire among European colonial powers, but the transformation of our common sense about the obvious way to live. Impatience with stupidity, it turns out, may be at least as powerful a force for change as outrage at injustice.

In the 1960s the political theorist Hannah Arendt showed not just how habitual lying fed totalitarianism but also how the mental categories of truth and falsehood were being eroded in democracies, too. “[T]he result of a consistent and total substitution of lies for factual truth is not that the lies will now be accepted as truth, and the truth by defamed as lies,” she wrote in 1967, “but that the sense by which we take our bearings in the real world—and the category of truth vs. falsehood is among the mental means to this end—is being destroyed.” For nearly a decade, we have been wondering where Donald Trump’s moral bottom might lie, when at a distance, Arendt was encouraging us to put the problem differently: to understand that what she called “Madison Avenue methods” were the principal feature of his style of politics. In a political and media space where no publicity is bad publicity, the only measure of right is notoriety. And then in the 1980s, Judith Shklar envisioned an ethics that put at its forefront not the preservation of liberty or the defense of individualism but rather the prevention of cruelty. Imagine today how debates in virtually any policy field would be transformed if we asked, as Shklar did, what it would mean to “put cruelty first” on our list of public bads.

Visibility, naturalness, notoriety, cruelty—liberal pluralists will have a richer vocabulary of political analysis if they work harder to fill out the maternal side of their intellectual family tree. At some point in the “Prison Notebooks,” the Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci quotes Benito Mussolini to the effect that fascists have lived contemporary history too much to have the obligation to know past history perfectly. Pluralists should aim at exactly the opposite. Berlin’s liberalism may be less suited to our own moment than his, but his method still holds. To get a handle on the past as well as on our own moment, we have to define more fully, as he put it, “the concepts in terms of which people speak and think.”

The great debates of Berlin’s own time—individual freedom versus state control, communal nationalism versus individualism, even certainty versus doubt, as Berlin saw things—were not timeless political or intellectual divides. They were produced by a specific historical moment and, he imagined, would likely fade into other debates, other great divides, as history moved on. Ideas now rule politics once again, but we should not expect that the concepts in terms of which people speak and think will be the same as those during the era of postwar liberalism, a time that—liberals, progressives, and conservatives alike might agree—is now at an end.","October 9, 2024",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
77,Europe’s Muslim Street,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/europes-muslim-street/,Ömer Taşpınar,"Islam may still be a faraway religion for millions of Americans. But for Europeans it is local politics. The 15 million Muslims of the European Union (EU)—up to three times as many as live in the United States—are becoming a more powerful political force than the fabled Arab street. Europe?s Muslims hail from different countries and display diverse religious tendencies, but the common denominator that links them to the Muslim world is their sympathy for Palestine and Palestinians. And unlike most of their Arab brethren, growing numbers of Europe?s Muslims can vote in elections that count.

This political ascendance threatens to exacerbate existing strains within the trans-Atlantic relationship. The presence of nearly 10 million Muslims versus only 700,000 Jews in France and Germany alone helps explain why continental Europe might look at the Middle East from a different angle than does the United States. Indeed, French and German concerns about a unilateral U.S. attack on Iraq or Washington?s blind support for Israel are at least partly related to nervousness about the Muslim street at home.

Whether Brussels, Berlin, Paris, or Washington like it or not, Europe?s Muslim constituencies are likely to become an even more vocal foreign policy lobby. Two trends are empowering Europe?s Muslim street: demographics and opportunities for full citizenship.

It?s worth remembering that Europe?s Muslim population is an unintended consequence of actions taken nearly a half century ago. During the postwar labor shortage in the 1950s and 1960s, Turks, Algerians, Moroccans, Tunisians, and Pakistanis were called to help spur Europe?s economic recovery. No host country expected these ?guestworkers,? as the Germans called them with characteristic frankness, to overstay their welcome. Like all good guests, they were supposed to leave, preferably when the recession hit and the party was over in the 1970s. They didn?t. Instead, their families joined them, and new generations of European Turks, Algerians, Moroccans, Tunisians, and Pakistanis were born.

More are on the way. Today, the Muslim birth rate in Europe is three times higher than the non-Muslim one. If current trends continue, the Muslim population of Europe will nearly double by 2015, while the non-Muslim population will shrink by 3.5 percent.

A parallel process of Muslim enfranchisement is accompanying this population surge. Nearly half of the 5 million to 7 million Muslims in France are already French citizens. The situation is similar for most of the 2 million Muslims in Great Britain. Most recently, in 2000, Germany joined the countries where citizenship is granted according to birthplace instead of ancestry. The new German citizenship laws added already a half million voters to the rolls and have opened the road to citizenship to all other Muslims in Germany. With currently 160,000 new Muslim citizens a year, the number of voters might total 3 million in the next decade.

In Germany and elsewhere in Europe, a Muslim swing vote is already having a critical impact. Consider the electoral push that newly enfranchised ?German Turks? gave to Germany?s incumbent Social Democrat (SPD)-Green coalition in last September?s down-to-the-wire election. These Muslim Germans punished the anti-immigrant Christian Democrats, who oppose Turkey?s membership to the EU. And they expressed their gratitude for efforts by the SPD-Green coalition to change the archaic laws of German citizenship. The bad news for the German Christian Democrats is that in the next general elections in 2006, roughly 1 million German Turks will be eager to cast their votes.

A big boost to the organizational capacity of Muslims in Europe came most recently from France, home to Europe?s largest Muslim community. The country?s diverse Muslim community is now represented by a unified French Council of the Islamic Faithu—a potential boon to its lobbying clout. French Muslims have also gained higher political visibility with the inclusion in Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin?s government of two cabinet members of North African origin.

Armed with the power of the vote and quickly learning the mechanics of lobbying, the Muslim street in Europe is on its way to having more political weight than the Arab street of Egypt or Saudi Arabia. But the attacks of September 11 have cast the growing influence of European Muslims in a more ominous light. Although the overwhelming majority of Muslims living in Europe (or, for that matter, the United States) are peaceful and law abiding, many European governments worry under their breath about the role of some European Muslims in past and future terrorist attacks—a concern stoked by the discovery of al Qaeda cells in Germany, France, Italy, and Britain. Given these not-so-latent suspicions and prejudices, one casualty of a major Islamic terrorist attack on European soil would likely be Europe?s budding multiculturalism.

Another major concern is the relationship between Europe?s Muslims and what is perceived in some quarters as Europe?s growing anti-Semitism. True, continental Europeans are much more critical of Israel and generally more supportive of the Palestinian cause. Overall, Europeans have a difficult time understanding how a small country like Israel can have so much influence over the sole superpower. But few in the United States notice that the communities most resentful of Israel in Europe are Muslim. The perpetrators of anti-Semitic incidents in France are not right-wing extremists protecting the ?French race? from Jewish contamination: The 400 or so anti-Semitic incidents documented in the country during 2001 have mostly been attributed to Muslim youth of North African origin. Such incidents tend to spike upwards during times of Israeli-Palestinian trouble—further proof of the Muslim role. Economic problems such as unemployment and a lack of upward mobility also contribute to the frustration of Muslims in Europe, who often feel discriminated against.

On the positive side, demographic growth and enfranchisement are already integrating European Muslims into the political mainstream and have the potential to produce a moderate type of Euro-Islam. Yet the implications of a more vocal Muslim lobby in Europe?s Middle East policy offer no good news for the United States. Home to a minuscule Jewish minority and growing Muslim masses, Europe will only get better at confronting the United States at the game of ethnic-lobby influence—a small price to pay, perhaps, for the emergence of a truly multicultural Europe.","March 1, 2003",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
78,China and Taiwan: An Offer Washington Ought to Consider,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/china-and-taiwan-an-offer-washington-ought-to-consider/,"Bates Gill, Michael E. O’Hanlon","Taiwan?s top envoy to the United States, Chen Chien-jen, made a remarkable public revelation late last month. In remarks before Taiwan?s legislature, he stated that during the October summit meeting between Presidents George W. Bush and Jiang Zemin, Jiang offered a deal involving the withdrawal or freezing of China?s short-range ballistic missiles deployed opposite Taiwan in return for U.S. restraint in its arms sales to Taiwan.

China has viewed its missile phalanx as its most effective coercive tool against Taiwan, and used it to bracket the island with warning shots in 1995 and 1996. This prompted the United States to implicitly threaten force in return by deploying aircraft carriers to the region. Thus Beijing?s offer—which a senior Chinese official has confirmed, according to a Washington Post report (IHT, Dec. 11)—could be of great significance.

But was the offer just a political gesture or a tactical ploy? One thing is clear: Without prejudicing their relationship to Taiwan, U.S. policymakers should test the idea and see how far Beijing is willing to take it.

Preoccupation with the war against terror, Iraq and now North Korea must not blind U.S. officials to any opportunity to defuse the only conflict that could plausibly take America to war against another great power in the early years of the 21st century.

Jiang?s offer may be part of a much larger effort by Beijing during the past 18 months, and especially since the terrorist attacks on the United States in September 2001, to put forward a more constructive and responsible international face, particularly in improving U.S.-Chinese relations.

Beijing?s toned down rhetoric in opposition to the U.S. missile defense program, its helpful contributions to the Washington-led counter-terror campaign, its willingness to support a new UN Security Council resolution on Iraq well before Russia or France would, and its recent request to open a security dialogue with NATO are examples of the trend.

China?s approach toward Taiwan has appeared markedly less shrill in recent months. Beijing has shown a more nuanced approach, giving greater emphasis to political and economic carrots while still strengthening its military stick. The missile offer could be a piece of that overall approach to draw Taiwan closer into China?s orbit.

But the Chinese offer of a trade-off may also be nothing more than a political gesture to gain some diplomatic high ground. Knowing that a missile redeployment or freeze would not substantially alter the real military balance on the ground, and knowing that it is unlikely that the United States would agree to any firm quid pro quo, Beijing can appear the conciliatory party.

With some 350 to 400 short- and medium-range missiles positioned opposite Taiwan, it could be that China?s deployments have reached a saturation point in any case.

How should Washington and Taipei respond? Some ideas are nonstarters. America should categorically refuse to limit arms sales to Taiwan for nonmissile threats, regardless of China?s willingness to freeze or reduce missile deployments. In particular, the Bush administration should not withdraw its offer to sell Taipei maritime patrol aircraft, submarines, Kidd-class destroyers and improved air-to-air missiles.

The United States should still abide by the “six assurances” it offered Taiwan in 1982. In particular, it pledged not to set any date to end arms sales to Taiwan and not to consult with China over the specifics of any weapons sale to Taiwan prior to making that sale.

America should also recognize that any reductions in Chinese missile deployments near Taiwan could be quickly reversed, and avoid responses that would be difficult to reverse.

Still, the Chinese offer is potentially far too significant to brush aside. The United States should encourage China to reduce its missile deployments unilaterally, and promise that any such decision would have important, if indirect, effects on its arms sales policy.

With less of a Chinese missile threat, Taiwan would have less need for controversial Aegis-class destroyers. It still may need improvements to its existing Patriot missile defense technology, but that measure might be postponed. Since Taiwan is having a hard time concluding arrangements for the weapons already promised in 2001, that may be a small price to pay.

The United States cannot make concrete promises to China about postponements, but it can suggest a process of phased mutual restraint that could build on itself.

Just as importantly, perhaps, Washington should continue discouraging Taiwan from developing more offensive capabilities, such as ballistic mis siles, which could be used for preemptive attacks against Chinese missile batteries and military bases.

Unless China really is prepared to eliminate missiles and stop building new ones, the potential for formal arms control is limited. But formal arms control is not always of the utmost importance, as the Bush administration has argued in withdrawing from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and opposing ratification of biological and nuclear testing accords.

In the triangular America-China-Taiwan context, the diplomatic process of beginning a dialogue on military restraint and improving security relations could itself be the single most important result of engaging Beijing on its offer. The Bush administration should not pass up the chance.","December 26, 2002",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
79,How racial bias in appraisals affects the devaluation of homes in majority-Black neighborhoods,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-racial-bias-in-appraisals-affects-the-devaluation-of-homes-in-majority-black-neighborhoods/,"Jonathan Rothwell, Andre M. Perry","Previous Brookings research found that homes are undervalued in majority-Black neighborhoods, yet could not identify why. Recently, the Federal Housing Finance Agency released new neighborhood-level data on home appraisals. Using this data in combination with other sources, this report draws the following conclusions on home appraisal bias’s effect on housing markets in majority-Black neighborhoods:

We continue to find that homes in Black neighborhoods are valued roughly 21% to 23% below what their valuations would be in non-Black neighborhoods. Neighborhoods with a majority of Latino or Hispanic, Asian American, or white residents do not experience home price devaluation, using the same model. Appraisal bias explains a fraction of the devaluation of homes in Black neighborhoods: approximately 9% to 19%, depending on modeling approaches. The vast majority of homes in majority-Black neighborhoods and throughout the country are appraised at or above their contract price, leaving much of the variance unaccounted for. The cost of devaluation across the 113 metro areas in the U.S. with at least one majority-Black neighborhood is approximately $162 billion.

Adjusting for characteristics of homes and neighborhoods, we find that appraisal transactions in majority-Black neighborhoods are 1.9 times more likely to be appraised under the contract price than homes in majority-white neighborhoods. Specifically, an additional 6% (13% versus 7%) of homes in Black neighborhoods are under-appraised relative to non-Black neighborhoods. After adjusting for characteristics of the homes and neighborhoods, this bias against homes in Black neighborhoods persists at a level of 4.4%. The bias is also found in over-appraisal; in majority-Black neighborhoods, an additional 5.2% of homes are appraised at or below the contract price when they would have been appraised above it if the home had been in a non-Black neighborhood. Taking these estimates together, we find that 10% of appraisals in majority-Black neighborhoods are valued on the wrong side of the contract price, compared to what would be expected in the absence of racial bias. Neighborhoods with a majority of Latino or Hispanic and Asian American residents are also more likely than majority-white neighborhoods to experience under-appraisal.

We estimate that the median appraisal is 15% lower in majority-Black neighborhoods compared to homes in neighborhoods where less than 1% of the population is Black. This result is estimated by modeling appraisal values as a function of actual sales prices as well as neighborhood and home characteristics.

Our overall conclusion is that at least 10% of homes are at risk of under-appraisal in majority-Black neighborhoods, and this has a modest but meaningful effect on overall valuations and final sales prices—limiting wealth accumulation for homeowners in majority-Black neighborhoods. Under-valuations also delay or cancel transactions, which reduces mutually beneficial market exchanges in Black communities.

At the same time, those seeking to make housing markets work more effectively in majority-Black neighborhoods will have to look beyond appraisal reform. Appraisal bias appears to explain less than 20% of overall devaluation, and most appraisals in majority-Black neighborhoods are above the contract price. Likely, lending and underwriting practices as well as consumer bias lower home values and reduce demand in majority-Black neighborhoods below what we would see if racism was absent.

Our previous research has shown that owner-occupied homes are substantially devalued in majority-Black neighborhoods. After considering the characteristics of homes and neighborhoods that are most important to buyers—age and size of the home, test scores at local elementary and secondary schools, proximity to stores, commuting times, and crime—we find that homes in Black neighborhoods are valued roughly 23% lower than similar homes in neighborhoods with few Black residents.

We and others have speculated that bias in the appraisal process may account for some of this discrepancy. Consistent with this expectation, economists at Freddie Mac estimated that homes in majority-Black neighborhoods are 1.7 times more likely to receive an appraisal below the final contract price compared to homes in predominantly white neighborhoods.

Still, the available evidence suggests appraisal effects are unlikely to explain most of the devaluation in Black neighborhoods. Most homes appraise at or above the final contract price. While a low appraisal could depress the final price, it more likely confirms a reasonable compromise between buyer and seller. A seller can also challenge a low appraisal. Additionally, our research on commercial real estate valuations shows that they are also devalued, despite the different actors and agencies involved.

Alternatively, participants in the housing market—including buyers—may exhibit systemic bias against Black neighborhoods, even in the absence of racist beliefs or discriminatory behaviors toward Black individuals. This bias may be the result of ignorance, prejudice, or both.

In October, the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) released a novel database that helps examine concerns about appraisal bias. The Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) relies on a standardized appraisal form sent to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac for single-family homes. FHFA staff constructed the database using approximately 46 million final appraisals.

The data is available for census tracts (which are akin to neighborhoods), and the FHFA reports the summary statistics on the value of appraisals, including the percentage of appraisals that were valued at, below, and above the contract price. The appraised value itself contains no information on discrimination; nor does the sale price. The value of a home is determined by many factors, but when analyzed alongside the contract price, the appraised value does contain insightful information.

Since the contract price is the price agreed to in the actual real estate market, it is a more relevant estimate of what the home is worth compared to the appraisal. If the potential contract price was too low, the seller would have a strong incentive to hold out for a better offer; if it was too high, the buyer would have a strong incentive to walk away. The appraiser’s job is to provide the lender an accurate assessment of the financial value of the home, so that it can weigh the risks of buying the home on behalf of the borrower and convey those risks to secondary market participants such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, who buy mortgages from smaller banks and sell them to investment banks and other investors. An appraiser who consistently over-values homes can be seen as injecting poor information and credit risk, as economist Paul Calem and co-authors have argued, but banks make money off transactions and many mortgages are resold in secondary markets. Thus, most banks have an incentive for the appraisers’ valuation to match or exceed the contract price, so that the transaction proceeds and generates fees for the bank and a product to sell.

In practice, most homes (usually above 60%) appraise above the contract price. This has been the case since 2013 (see Figure 1), but it has dipped somewhat in recent years—perhaps because the pace of inflation has caught some appraisers by surprise. The share of homes that under-appraise is typically below 10%, but that rose sharply in 2021 and stands near 16% in the middle of 2022. Only around one-quarter of homes appraise at the contract price.

Analyzing the UAD data on the percentage of homes that are over- or under-valued relative to the contract price can give some insight into this question. This test has the advantage of classifying homes into simple bins (under-valued, over-valued, and appropriately valued), but only in relation to whether or not the appraisal matches the contract price (which only happens in about 25% of cases). An important limitation of this analysis is that it says nothing about the extent of under-valuation, and it cannot be used to estimate the percentage of homes under-valued compared to a hypothetical case of no discrimination. However, it does provide a lower-bound estimate by allowing directional calculations of appraisal values relative to the contract price.

Imagine that homes in majority-Black neighborhoods were just as likely to be under-valued as homes in majority-white neighborhoods—but every under-valued home in a majority-Black neighborhood was undervalued by 50%, whereas under-valued homes in white neighborhoods were only undervalued by 1%. The “directional” analysis would fail to detect this bias.

With this in mind, we do find important evidence of appraisal bias, consistent with previous work from Freddie Mac. Without any adjustments for home or neighborhood characteristics, homes in majority-Black neighborhoods are about 6 percentage points (ppt) more likely to be under-appraised relative to the contract price compared to homes in neighborhoods with a Black population share of less than 1% (see Figure 2).

We know homes and neighborhoods have important differences in underlying characteristics that are valuable to market participants. Thus, as in our previous work, we gathered data by census tract for the size, age, and other characteristics of homes in each tract, as well as neighborhood features such as test scores and proximity to amenities. We analyzed 2016-2020 appraisals using 2016-2020 census data.

After adjusting for home and neighborhood characteristics—using the same variables from our 2018 paper—the estimated under-appraisal effect falls only slightly, to 4.4 ppt. At the same time, homes in majority-Black neighborhoods are 5.2 ppt less likely to be over-appraised, using the same model but replacing the percent under-appraised with the percent over-appraised.

Taken together, about 10% of homes in majority-Black neighborhoods are affected by the direction of appraisal bias compared to homes in neighborhoods with few Black residents. But this does not tell us the extent of the bias. If under-valuation is more severe in majority-Black neighborhoods than non-Black neighborhoods when it occurs, this result will be obscured by the directional analysis.

We ran the above analysis separately for each large racial and ethnic group. Neighborhoods with a majority of Latino or Hispanic or Asian American residents are also more likely to experience below-contract price appraisals than neighborhoods with few of those residents. The estimated effect is slightly lower than that found in majority-Black neighborhoods. Meanwhile, majority-white neighborhoods are much less likely to experience an under-appraisal compared to neighborhoods with few white residents. The predicted effect on under-appraisal for majority-white neighborhoods is -6.1 ppt. When applied to the mean for all tracts, this predicts that only 2.2% of appraisals in majority-white neighborhoods are under the contract price, compared to 12.6% in majority-Black neighborhoods, 11.5% in majority-Latino or -Hispanic neighborhoods, and 11.1% in majority-Asian-American neighborhoods (Table 1).

Majority-white neighborhoods differ from neighborhoods with single-group non-white majorities in that they are experiencing slower housing price appreciation (according to 2016 to 2020 Redfin sales data) and are less likely to sell homes above asking. This suggests that majority-white neighborhoods are “cooler” markets, which may make appraisals more predictable. But this does not seem to explain the results. Adding controls for price growth and the percentage of homes sold above asking has little effect on the above results. Likewise, if homes values are easier to predict in majority-white neighborhoods, then homes should not be any more likely to be over-appraised—but we find that they are.

The UAD does not provide data on the contract price—only the appraisal value and the ratio of the appraised value to contract price. Sale price data is available from other sources. To quantify the appraisal penalty to Black neighborhoods in dollar terms, we combined the UAD with data on sales from Redfin, a national real estate brokerage.

Conditional on the median sale price, the Black population share should make no difference to the median appraised value if the appraisal market was working fairly. But our analysis shows otherwise. Using our preferred list of control variables from our earlier research and including the median sale price from Redfin, we find a large negative effect of Black population shares on the median appraisal value. Homes in majority-Black census tracts receive a median appraisal 15.2% lower than sales prices would predict, adjusting for other factors (see Figure 3).1 The model predicts 89% of the variation in median appraisals, so it is unlikely that omitted variables are driving this result, though it is certainly possible. Appraisals are expected to be lower when the quality of the home—including whether and how it was renovated—is lower, but the sale price already takes those conditions into account.

Thus, even though 90% of homes in majority-Black neighborhoods are appraised “in the same direction” as homes in non-Black neighborhoods, the extent of the penalty appears to be much higher and more pervasive. The distribution of appraisals in majority-Black neighborhoods is out of alignment with the market.

Appraisals below contract can have large effects on the market. A 2016 paper by Hamilton Fout and Vincent Yao found that an appraisal below contract price increases the odds that the sale price is reduced by 8% to 51%, and the probability that a sale is delayed or canceled rises from 25% to 32%. Estimates from that research suggest that under-appraisal reduces a home’s value by around 3.5% in large metropolitan areas, with negligible results on the overall market, as most homes are not under-appraised relative to the contract price.

Our results are consistent with Fout and Yao’s findings. A standard deviation in the share of properties valued below contract price predicts a 4.5% lower price per square foot in our preferred model that otherwise omits the racial composition of the neighborhood. Given our estimates above that homes in majority-Black neighborhoods are 4.4 ppt more likely to be under-valued, we can calculate how sales prices are affected in Black neighborhoods. We estimate that under-appraisal bias results in a 3.3% reduction in the sales price per square foot in majority-Black neighborhoods. We estimate a 4.5% reduction using the final sale price rather than the price per square foot.

The lost value resulting from appraisal bias can be used to estimate how overall devaluation is affected. We return to our 2018 work and re-estimate devaluation in our new database. Doing so and using the above results, we find that appraisal bias explains roughly 15% to 19% of overall devaluation in Black neighborhoods. Using an alternative method described below, we find that appraisal bias explains 9% to 14% of overall devaluation and as much as 17% of lower appraisals.

We restrict this analysis to the 102 metropolitan areas with at least one majority Black neighborhood. We also give extra weight in the analysis to metro areas with larger Black populations to reduce the influence of measurement error; as such, the estimates should be thought of as characterizing the experience of the average Black person living in different types of metropolitan areas.

To reach these results, we first replicate our 2018 analysis and predict home values as a function of the Black population share and a rich set of housing and neighborhood characteristics. This produces results that match our previous work, despite using different measures of home values over a different time period (2016 to 2020 instead of 2012 to 2016). Using self-reported census valuations, a home in a neighborhood that is 50% Black is valued 23% lower than a home in a neighborhood with no Black residents. Using sales prices adjusted for square footage, the value is 21% lower. Based on this estimate, the cost of devaluation is approximately $162 billion.

To see how appraisal bias affects these results, we include it directly in the regression model. Because appraisal bias is correlated with the Black population share, the devaluation estimate falls (as predicted) by 9% to 14% of the total. Thus, these results suggest that even in the absence of appraisal bias, homes in Black neighborhoods will be undervalued by approximately 20%.

The devaluation of appraisal values in Black neighborhoods is very similar to the devaluation in sales prices and self-reported home values, suggesting that the overall housing market—not just the appraisal process—is driving the results. Even adjusting for low appraisals, we predict that appraisals would undervalue homes in Black neighborhoods by approximately 20%, with slightly higher devaluation at the top end of the market.

Among the large racial and ethnic groups in the United States, devaluation is unique to Black neighborhoods. Using our preferred outcome (median sale price per square foot), we re-ran the analysis above using Latino or Hispanic, Asian American, and white neighborhoods, and compared majority-group status with group shares below 1%. Despite the appraisal bias documented above, we find little to no evidence of devaluation in Latino or Hispanic and Asian American neighborhoods. Size-adjusted sales prices are no higher or lower in majority-Latino or -Hispanic neighborhoods than in neighborhoods with a Latino or Hispanic population share lower than 1%. Prices are slightly higher in majority-Asian-American neighborhoods (6%) and much higher in majority-white neighborhoods (35%), relative to the 32% devaluation in majority-Black neighborhoods. Note, this 32% figure for devaluation in majority-Black neighborhoods is higher than the 21% from the table above because it includes all neighborhoods with 50% or more Black population shares, whereas the table reports the estimated penalty when the neighborhood is exactly 50% Black.

The new FHFA data on appraisals have allowed for novel analysis of the appraisal process and how it functions in majority-Black and other neighborhoods. Appraisals usually come in above the final market price, and the banks who purchase appraisal services have an incentive for this outcome. But whether the appraisal comes in below, above, or at the contract price should not vary by neighborhood demographics, unless there is something about the neighborhood that affects the appraisal more than the sale price. Our analysis controls for the characteristics real estate agents and housing market participants consider, and still finds that race has a strong effect on the direction of appraisals away from the contract price. Moreover, appraisal values are systematically lower (by 15%) in majority-Black neighborhoods, even given sale prices and other attributes. Altogether, the evidence strongly suggests that appraisers introduce systemic bias that favors white neighborhoods at the expense of Black, Latino or Hispanic, and Asian American neighborhoods.

One is that our measure of appraisal bias (from FHFA data) is benchmarked against the contract price and limited to reporting the percentage of homes that fall at, above, or below that price. This is likely to understate bias because it ignores the degree of bias within each group. The UAD contains a ratio that measures the contract price divided by the appraisal price, and this data is consistent with the above analysis. But this appears to be a noisy measure of bias, as it is less correlated with the final sale price than the “percent appraised below contract” variable. Theoretically, the ratio could easily be distorted by outliers. For example, most homes sold in a neighborhood could be appraised well below their actual value, but if a few relatively expensive homes are appraised well above, the ratio for the neighborhood will look unbiased.

A more fundamental problem with measuring appraisal bias by comparing the contract price to the appraisal value is that the contract price is not necessarily a measure of a home’s “true” value, for several reasons.

First, if sellers anticipate a low appraisal, they have a strong incentive to lower the contract price, so that the deal does not fall through. Many homebuyers make their offer contingent upon appraisal to avoid being stuck with an unexpected payment that they cannot finance, in the event of a low appraisal.

More importantly, the broader real estate market may devalue homes in majority-Black neighborhoods, including buyers. If appraisals were removed from the real estate market process, we estimate that homes would still be devalued in majority-Black neighborhoods by around 20%—but not in Latino or Hispanic, Asian American, or white neighborhoods. Along these lines, we find that appraisal bias can only explain 9% to 19% of overall devaluation of homes in Black neighborhoods. Even in majority-Black neighborhoods, most homes (87%, without adjustment) appraise at or above their contract price, with the majority (61%) appraised above.

Rooting out discrimination demands that scrutiny goes beyond appraisals and appraisers. Early in his administration, President Joe Biden announced the formation of the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) to address racial bias in home appraisals. In March 2022, PAVE released its final action plan—the most wide-ranging set of reforms ever put forward to advance equity in the home appraisal process. The plan lays out 21 actions to be taken by 13 federal agencies, including the development of new rules to remove discrimination from every stage of the home valuation process as well as efforts to build a more diverse home appraiser workforce.

In 2018, we found a 23% value difference between majority-Black neighborhoods and places where the Black population share is less than 1%, but we could not explain why. Now, the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s new dataset gives researchers the ability to see the extent that appraisal bias devalues homes. Still, if upward of 20% of the value gap can be attributed to appraisal bias, then what about the other 80%? In future work, we will maintain a focus on home values and investigate the fundamental reasons why consumers and other market actors undervalue homes in majority-Black neighborhoods.

80,The Chinese Growth Experience: A Golden Tapestry,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-chinese-growth-experience-a-golden-tapestry/,Eswar Prasad,"This is a review of the book “China’s Great Economic Transformation”, edited by Loren Brandt and Thomas Rawski (Cambridge University Press, 2008). A revised version is forthcoming in the Journal of International Economics.

There is an old Chinese saying that “A book holds a house of gold.” This volume edited by two eminent scholars on China is an impressive achievement and certainly yields a treasure trove of detailed information and thoughtful analysis of the Chinese economy.

Not that there is a dearth of books on China. After all, an economy that has grown at an average rate of about 10 percent per annum for over two decades, has over a billion people, and has vaulted over others to become the third-largest in the world tends to draw attention. What makes this volume stand out from the crowd is the sheer wealth of material that is brought to bear on different aspects of the growth process and their implications for economic welfare and sustainability of that growth.

China seems to fly against conventional notions of what drives growth—it has an underdeveloped and inefficient financial system, a weak legal framework, dominant state monopolies in many sectors, high levels of corruption, capital controls on inflows and outflows, and the list goes on. Even more strikingly, it had–until recently–registered ever-higher growth rates during this decade while exporting increasingly large amounts of capital, which is the opposite of the standard prescription that developing economies should import capital to increase investment and raise their growth rates.

Has China changed the laws of economics? This is an intriguing question and there are chapters in this book that either directly or indirectly try to frame and address this issue in different ways. For instance, the chapter by Allen, Qian and Qian highlights the deficiencies in the formal financial system. But these authors argue that the informal financial system has done an adequate job of filling in the gaps. Similarly, the chapter on the legal system points out the weaknesses in the formal legal system and suggests that alternative informal institutions have served as a workable substitute.

The Chinese growth experience is a Rorschach test, allowing researchers to project their own prejudices on their interpretations of its growth experience and the reasons for its success. Pro-globalizers and anti-globalizers both see China as conclusive evidence of the validity of their worldviews. But it is indeed an intriguing question whether China is sui generis or if there are important generalizable lessons that other low and middle-income countries can take away from its economic success.

Many observers have argued that the Chinese success story stands as a clear repudiation of the so-called Washington Consensus, which is seen as an encapsulation of free-market principles. On the other hand, the statements of Chinese authorities themselves suggest that they see financial development, reform of state enterprises, and better institutions as essential for growth to continue at a rapid pace. Perhaps once again policymakers are proving far more adroit at striking a reasonable balance than academic dogmas that tend to extreme positions. This comes through in a number of chapters, which show that policies implemented by Chinese authorities don’t always fit in to conventional categories but somehow seem to deliver the goods. Indeed, despite state control of much of the industrial sector and various other distortions relative to free-market benchmarks, even total factor productivity growth has been mystifyingly strong (see Bosworth and Collins, 2008, for a comparative perspective with India). This book provides a good starting point for thinking about the often-unconventional mechanisms involved in delivering these good economic outcomes.

China’s approach to market-oriented reforms, including the political economy aspects of a move towards less state control of the economy, is explored in a number of chapters. The gradualist and incremental approach seems to have worked quite well in terms of moving the economy along the reform path without exposing it to major risks. For instance, tax or social expenditure reforms are sometimes instituted in one or a small set of provinces on a trial basis. Lessons from those experiences are then incorporated into revised policy designs before rolling out those reforms nationally. This is learning by doing at its pragmatic best.

China has also tried to embrace globalization in a calibrated way that permits it to use external forces to push through domestic reforms but without the attendant risks of full opening-up. This set of policies includes active encouragement of inflows of foreign direct investment and associated technology transfers while trying to keep out other more volatile forms of capital; use of trade opening and the ensuing exposure to foreign competition to get domestic firms to increase efficiency; and use of the commitment to liberalize financial services and open up the banking sector to foreign entrants as a deadline to induce domestic banks to make rapid progress on revamping themselves.

As Prasad and Rajan (2006) point out, however, this approach may be less viable now that the economy has become much more complex and market-oriented, making it easier for private agents to unravel limited reforms. Moreover, gradualism in certain reforms such as permitting more exchange rate flexibility, putting in place an alternative monetary policy framework, and capital account liberalization may be infeasible or, in some cases, even counter-productive.

Before one gets swept away with the enviable growth performance, it is also useful to reflect on what negative consequences the growth model has wrought in terms of long-term welfare and efficiency. Justin Lin (2008), for instance, has described the Chinese approach as a Comparative Advantage Defying strategy of industrial development, which has delivered many benefits but created its own problems. Subsidies to capital, land and energy have made investment the prime driver of growth; a significant portion of this investment is financed through an inefficient financial intermediation system and may not be productive. This growth strategy and its collateral costs like severe environmental degradation are explored in various chapters. Moreover, households save a large fraction of their disposable income (on average, nearly 25 percent) and get low or even negative rates of return on their savings from a repressed financial system (Chamon and Prasad, 2009). This represents a huge but hidden welfare cost of the growth model. The Chinese face a big challenge in rebalancing growth to make it more welfare-enhancing and sustainable (Blanchard and Giavazzi, 2006). This book describes many of these challenges but appropriately puts them into the context of the tremendous progress that has been made in improving standards of living and reducing poverty. After all, no matter how it is achieved, double-digit growth rates over an extended period solve far more problems than they create.

The interplay between economics and politics is of course fascinating in a country like China, which has had little political freedom but where the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party increasingly comes from its ability to deliver a rapidly rising standard of living to its masses. The political economy dimensions of various policies and structural changes in the economy are nicely woven through a number of chapters in the book. Interestingly, the front cover of the book shows a picture of a Chinese farmer framed against the impressive backdrop of a glittering skyline. But the skyline is that of Hong Kong rather than mainland China. Perhaps this is how the editors want to subtly convey the complex economic and political web that is flexible enough to accommodate many extremes.

One noteworthy feature of the book is that it blends together top-down analysis with a careful examination of data at different levels of disaggregation, including microeconomic firm-level and household-level data. Case studies of particular industries lend color to the big picture (there is a particularly interesting one on the evolution of the beer industry in Chapter 15), while the analysis of income inequality and spatial disparities in development hint at the complex challenges on the social stability front even if overall growth stays strong.

The book also has an impressive amount of data in the form of charts and tables. Chinese data tend to be rather dodgy in many respects, both because of weaknesses in data collection procedures and because of incentives facing officials reporting the data. For instance, it has long been the case that the sum of all provinces’ GDP is considerably higher than national GDP. During the 1990s, there were questions about whether GDP growth was being overstated in the official figures to make the economy look in better shape than it was; in the mid-2000s, the view of many experts was that the official numbers may be understating growth to avoid perceptions of overheating. The authors of various chapters in this book are conversant with the subtleties of the data issues in their respective subject areas. Hence, the reader is presented with cleaned-up and more reliable data, along with critical perspectives on specific data series.

While the book is massive and covers a lot of ground, there are many interesting topics that inevitably get less attention than they deserve. This no doubt came down to a matter of editorial choice, but I was surprised to note that, with so much attention focused on China’s exchange rate regime and the massive buildup of foreign exchange reserves in recent years, the discussion of those topics is mostly limited to a couple of brief sections in two chapters. A more detailed analysis of the implications of China’s mix of external policies that have resulted in current and capital account surpluses and consequent accumulation of reserves would have helped round out the discussion of how China’s domestic and external economic policies have shaped the nature of its engagement with the world economy. I would also have liked to see more discussion of monetary policy, which is intimately connected with financial market issues and also ties in to the broader subject of macroeconomic stability (see Prasad, 2009).

But these are quibbles reflecting my prejudices. After all, the Chinese growth experience presents a vast canvas for researchers to paint on and no single book can do justice to it all. The bottom line is that this book admirably achieves its editors’ objective of providing “…a rich tapestry of information and analysis that expands the foundation on which future research can be built.” This volume is indeed destined to become part of the essential collection of reference and source materials for scholars as well as students of the Chinese economy.

83,Too much tribalism? National service to the rescue,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/too-much-tribalism-national-service-to-the-rescue/,"Isabel V. Sawhill, John Bridgeland","The survival of the human species has always depended on loyalty to a particular tribe.  Group identity is a basic, almost instinctual, part of life.  But the form it takes matters. An identity organized around family, local community, or nation is different than one organized around race, religion, gender, or class.  The question is whether we can channel our tribal instincts in a more productive and socially beneficial direction.  Can we build bridges rather than walls?

One way to do this is to create more opportunity for those from diverse backgrounds to work together on a common enterprise.  In an “us-vs-them” world, the best antidote to cultural divisions may be for the “us” to get to know the “them” at a personal level working together on a well-defined challenge.

Military service is the classic example.  Those who have fought side by side on the battlefield typically form strong bonds of friendship and loyalty to one another even when they have little else in common.  Similarly, the anti-immigrant attitudes that gave rise to Trump in America and to Brexit in the UK are found mostly in communities with few immigrants.  When you don’t know “the other,” stereotypes flourish.

One powerful idea to rebuild our civic bridges is universal national service.  We should create a strong expectation that every young person as they come of age give at least one year of service—either military or civilian—and be provided with a structured opportunity to do so. This could restore our identity as Americans; it might even help us rediscover what makes us exceptional.

National service is not a new idea.  In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt mobilized 250,000 young unemployed men to serve in a Civilian Conservation Corps within months of his announcing it. In his 1961 Inaugural Address, John F. Kennedy summoned a generation that led to the creation of the Peace Corps and its domestic equivalent VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America). Bill Clinton created AmeriCorps, which George H.W. Bush seeded and George W. Bush expanded.

The number applying to serve in Peace Corps, VISTA and AmeriCorps, however, far exceeds the current opportunities to do so, turning away a generation raising their hands to serve their country.  This is true, notwithstanding that the idea of large-scale voluntary national service remains very popular among voters with about four out of five supporting it.

National service has many virtues. With rights come responsibilities or as William F. Buckley put it, “Materialistic democracy beckons every man to make himself a king; republican citizenship incites every man to be a knight.” Citizenship should mean more than paying taxes and voting – it includes leaving behind a better country than one inherits. As an AmeriCorps volunteer and veteran asked a group assembled at the Brookings Institution recently, “if you have the ability to affect positive change, don’t you have a moral obligation to do so?”

Service provides young people opportunities to cultivate their skills and character and to become leaders.  It provides benefits to communities and to those in need whether they are the victims of natural disasters, the elderly, children struggling to read, or the homeless. Its greatest virtue may be strengthening social bonds, substituting a beneficial form of tribalism for the less worthy versions that have so corroded our politics and civic life.

Is there any evidence that a more robust program of national service  would work, be affordable, and bring people together to bridge our cultural divisions?

An earlier review of 139 studies showed that the ratio of positive findings to less positive ones was 7 to 1.  To be sure, the costs for even modest stipends and for the educational benefits provided to those who complete their service are substantial.

Expanding national service to 1 million participants would likely cost about $17 billion.[i] Asking American families to voluntarily host a young person during their year of service could substantially reduce these outlays. In San Diego, young volunteers are living with the elderly, both of whom benefit from sharing one household. Moreover, a careful study by Clive Belfield shows that the benefits outweigh costs to taxpayers by two to one and to society by nearly four to one.

As for the effects of service on our current tribalism, a recent analysis in one national service program, Teach for America (TFA), showed that the participating teachers became more empathetic, less prejudiced, and more understanding of the challenges faced by the children they taught. This study is the latest and most convincing effort to show that the problem of “us-vs-them” can be greatly ameliorated by expanded opportunities for people from different backgrounds to work together.

Although young people should be the primary target of national service, there is no reason why retired Americans, veterans trying to reintegrate into civilian life, or anyone looking to do more for their community should not be provided the opportunity to do so.

Changing the culture to make national service the norm rather than the exception will be hard. But if employers and colleges give preference to those who have served, if the media highlights their accomplishments, and if the expectation gets sufficiently embedded in the culture, it can be done.

A distinguished group of Americans, including General Stanley McCrystal, Robert Gates, Condoleezza Rice, Howard Schultz and others associated with Service Year Alliance has now launched a campaign to expand national service. As they have said, America is too big and our challenges too great for small ideas.  And with bipartisan support, this big idea could not only be enacted tomorrow, but also strengthen our faltering democracy for decades to come.","November 13, 2019",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
84,Local Groups are the Key to America’s Civic Renewal,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/local-groups-are-the-key-to-americas-civic-renewal/,William C. Schambra,"In a leaky, drafty former VFW hall on Milwaukee’s northwest side, Pastor Gerald Saffold is busy rebuilding civil society. Of course, that’s not how he would describe what he’s doing. He would say that he’s bringing souls to Christ—using his gift for music to draw inner-city teens into his “Unity in the Community” Choir, where former gang leaders and drug dealers help him write the songs and choreograph the dances they then perform all over the city.

Nonetheless, here is an unmistakable act of civic renewal, and under the least hospitable circumstances imaginable. Where before there were inner-city gangs of radically alienated, angry teens, there is emerging today a cohesive community, united in common endeavor, mutually developing skills of cooperation, leadership, and citizenship.

Yet, sadly, we as a society do not seem inclined to celebrate this simple gospel choir as a significant civic event. (And this, ironically, in the very face of Professor Robert Putnam’s now famous discovery of the link between active choral societies and civic health.) Instead, we seem to be scanning the horizon for larger countrywide movements, for a sweetening of our collective national mood, a restoration of national cohesiveness.

How did we arrive at this preoccupation with national cohesiveness? That is the story of the idea of national community—the central concept and overriding goal of 20th-century American progressive liberalism. Early in the 20th century, our leading political intellectuals—foremost among them Walter Lippmann, Herbert Croly, and John Dewey—concluded that the forces of modernity were rapidly and irretrievably eroding the traditional institutions of civil society. Within such institutions—small towns, churches, neighborhoods, and ethnic and religious groups—Americans had traditionally governed themselves, established and preserved their own vigorous moral and religious cultures, cared for their most vulnerable, and met the human yearning for community.

But now, the progressives warned, the boundaries of these “island communities” had been hopelessly ruptured by modern technologies—the railroad, telegraph, telephone, the high-speed press, the corporation. These same technologies, however, made possible a new and dramatically improved form of community—the great national community. Elaborate communications and transportation networks would pull the nation together even as they pulled the village apart. And the emerging social sciences would tame the disintegrative sociological and psychological effects of modernity, once enough experts in government, business, and the nonprofit sector were trained in them and organized into the imposing bureaucracies that would now “scientifically manage” all human affairs.

To bring comprehensive order to all these forces, Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed in 1912, we now required a far more powerful central government. At the apex of this new federal apparatus, a dynamic, articulate president would mount the “bully pulpit” and summon the American people out of modernity’s fragmented individualism into unified, high-minded national endeavor. The stirring rhetoric of national crisis and war would provide the metaphors needed to make the American people sense, as the late Robert Nisbet put it, “their mystic national oneness.”

This century’s political life has been dominated by the project of building a great national community or family or village, peaking in Lyndon Johnson’s effort to “turn unity of interest into unity of purpose, and unity of goals into unity in the Great Society.” We have been exhorted by Franklin Roosevelt to unite in the face of the Great Depression “as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline;” by John F. Kennedy to “ask not what our country can do for us, but what we can do for our country;” by Lyndon Johnson to wage a “war on poverty.” Through these galvanizing metaphors of war and crisis, the presidency sought to fulfill its primary purpose, which is, as Walter Mondale put it in 1984, to “make us a community and keep us a community.”

As noble as this ideal may seem—as necessary as national unity may be in the face of genuine emergencies or war—progressivism’s national community has proven in political practice to be this century’s greatest disappointment. Though it has drained the strength and moral authority from local community institutions, it has failed to build the promised national substitute.

The national community’s contempt for and campaign to eradicate local civic institutions is a bedrock of 20th-century elite discourse. Local institutions, it is said, are notoriously and hopelessly backward, partial, parochial, reactionary, and riddled with irrational myths and prejudices. They cling stubbornly to obscure and retrograde notions of traditional morality and religious faith, rather than bowing sensibly to the authority of scientifically credentialed professionals and experts, who alone can exploit the potential of modernity.

How many campus-bred intellectual doctrines, how many short stories and novels, how many Hollywood movies and television shows, have reveled in this contrast between shabby, small-minded, local prejudices and a sophisticated, expansive attachment to national ideals? Given the unremitting hostility of America’s elites throughout this century, is it any wonder that local civic institutions might today find themselves in an uphill struggle for survival?

That the idea of national community has failed to deliver on its central promise—to reestablish at the level of the nation as a whole the sense of belonging, purpose, and self-governance that local institutions once provided—is now commonly considered a conservative argument. But the insight by no means originated on the right. Indeed, as Nisbet pointed out, conservatism wasted much of this century futilely extolling the virtues of rugged individualism and the untrammeled marketplace in the face of America’s manifest yearning for some form of community.

Rather, the bankruptcy of the idea of national community was the central insight of the New Left of the 1960s and of Saul Alinsky’s community organizers, before and since. They initially and correctly observed that the Great Society had not in fact delivered the great community, but rather only the cold, distant, alienated bureaucracies of “corporate liberalism.” The vast, impersonal institutions of business and government, they argued, simply could not provide the self-governance and community of “participatory democracy” for which the human spirit yearned.

Conservatism has indeed more recently taken up this general theme, though not at all in the spirit of the ?60s. To be sure, participatory democracy is essential for human happiness, conservatism maintains, but the peculiarly American way of achieving it has always been through dutiful citizenship within traditional, local institutions like the church, neighborhood, and voluntary association. That Republican presidents were swept into office throughout the past three decades on this theme proved its power; that a Democratic president recently won reelection on this same theme marks its moment of supreme triumph.

But the subtle allure of the national community idea is still very much evident today and tends to undermine even the most sincere efforts to restore civic institutions. Our national ambivalence is nicely reflected in Hillary Rodham Clinton’s recent It Takes a Village.

Ms. Clinton readily concedes what progressivism had denied for much of this century—that strong families, neighborhoods, and churches, far from being merely nurseries of reaction and bigotry, are essential to the physical, psychological, and moral well-being of children. That stated, however, she quickly reverts to themes more congenial to the project of national community: that such traditional local institutions have been hopelessly undercut by technology; that we therefore must now rely heavily on the advice and assistance of trained professionals and experts; and that we should consider a variety of new government institutions to ensure that all families are able to secure such advice and assistance. The small, real-life village quickly yields to the metaphorical national village.

Likewise, discussions of revitalizing civil institutions tend to focus on a limited range of major national nonprofits like the PTA or the Red Cross, which are by no means incompatible with the idea of national community. Though these organizations may have local chapters, they often look to the Washington office for marching orders, receive federal funding, press policy agendas on the federal government, and have gradually displaced the leadership of local amateurs and volunteers with centralized bureaucracies of scientifically trained experts and professionals. Such “acceptable” civic institutions can even be counted on to go before congressional committees and testify that they would languish, rather than prosper, were government’s benevolent presence to be diminished any further.

It is now permissible—indeed, fashionable—to fret about the health of such organizations, because of course they do not at all undermine, but rather tend to reinforce, the upward political tug of the national community idea. It is seldom noted that perhaps their health is imperiled precisely because they have exchanged their historic roots in the neighborhood for invitations to cocktails in the salons of our political and cultural elites. Perhaps their predicament is not a proper gauge of the well-being of American civil society after all.

These examples suggest that while the moral authority of the idea of national community has been seriously eroded over the past several decades, it has nonetheless left in its wake towering bureaucracies of elites and experts—not only within government, but in the nonprofit sector as well—who have powerful vested interests in the renationalization of the idea of community. As they argue eloquently and forcefully, “civic renewal” means restoring the deference and respect owed by a mystifyingly ungrateful public to the major institutions working on behalf of the noble idea of national community.

I would suggest, on the contrary, that it’s time to look in the opposite direction, away from the exhausted ideal of national community and toward the small but vigorous civic community that Pastor Saffold is building on Milwaukee’s northwest side. As Bob Woodson has argued so forcefully over the years, there are in fact hundreds of Saffolds in America’s inner cities, working quietly, successfully, and without public acclaim to battle drug abuse, educate children, reclaim teens from gangs, and rebuild neighborhood economies—in other words, to accomplish as small, local civic institutions what government bureaucracies never could.

Throughout our nation faith-based grass-roots leaders are managing—at a time and in places where the bureaucracies of business and government and the mainstream nonprofits have thrown up their hands and fled—to resurrect the institutions and principles of civil society. They are civil society’s trauma specialists—and the true experts on civic renewal.

Yet to our elites, these grass-roots initiatives are invisible, or if visible, dismissed as charismatic exceptions or inspiring but isolated anecdotes. After all, they’re not docile subsidiaries of the larger, “acceptable” nonprofits, but rather scrappy, scruffy, fiercely independent local initiatives, too busy working with the poor to join coalitions against poverty. They are not staffed by credentialed bureaucrats, but by volunteers whose chief credential may be that they themselves have only recently overcome the daunting circumstances of the inner city. They place little faith in the rehabilitative powers of the social sciences, but witness every day the fruits of their faith in the transformative power of God.

The disdain of elites notwithstanding, we should heed the wisdom of these grass-roots leaders who have, against heavy odds, accomplished the civic revival that we wish for all our communities. We should appreciate them, honor them, celebrate them. We should also highlight the ways in which private and public resources can be redirected to those who have already accomplished so much with virtually no outside help at all. Here the federal government should have a role too—not as grand builder of national community, but as humble servant to the genuine community-builders within our neighborhoods.

When the VFW decided a while back to close its hall on Milwaukee’s northwest side, no doubt that retreat of a major national nonprofit was carefully toted up as one more loss on Professor Putnam’s gloomy balance sheet of civil society. When Gerald Saffold once again filled the old hall with joyous music, no doubt that vigorous advance of civic renewal went unrecorded. It is past time to direct our gaze away from the failed project of national community and focus once again on the churches, voluntary associations, and grass-roots groups that are rebuilding America’s civil society one family, one block, one neighborhood at a time.","September 1, 1997",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
85,History’s message about regulating AI,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/historys-message-about-regulating-ai/,Tom Wheeler,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is “summoning the demon,” Elon Musk warned, continuing a great tradition of fearful warnings about new technology. In the 16th century, the Vicar of Croyden warned how Gutenberg’s demonic press would destroy the faith: “’We must root out printing or printing will root us out,’ the Vicar told his flock.”1 Preceding Musk’s invocation of the devil by a couple of centuries, an Ohio school board declared the new steam railroad technology to be “a device of Satan to lead immortal souls to hell.”2 Others warned of secular effects: The passing of a steam locomotive would stop cows from grazing, hens from laying, and precipitate economic havoc as horses became extinct and hay and oats farmers went bankrupt.3 Only a few years later, demonic fears appeared once again when Samuel Morse’s assistant telegraphed from Baltimore suggesting suspension of the trial of the first telegraph line. Why? Because the city’s clergy were preaching that messages by sparks could only be the work of the devil. Morse’s assistant feared these invocations would incite riots to destroy the equipment.4

We chuckle at these stories now, but they were once the manifestation of very real fears about the dangers of new technologies. They echo today in our discussions regarding the dangers of artificial intelligence. As evidenced by Musk’s concerns as well as those of other prominent individuals, there are many fears that AI will, among other things, impoverish people, invade their privacy, lead to all-out surveillance, and eventually control humanity.

“As we consider artificial intelligence, we would be wise to remember the lessons of earlier technology revolutions—to focus on the technology’s effects rather than chase broad-based fears about the technology itself.”

In assessing the reality of these claims, it is instructive to look to the lessons of history. Experience with new technologies teaches us that most inventions generated both good and bad results. They were classic “dual-impact” products that helped people at the same time they created harms. As I argue in this paper, a crucial variable in mitigating possible harms was the policy and regulatory response to counteract negative ramifications of the new technology. As we consider artificial intelligence, we would be wise to remember the lessons of earlier technology revolutions—to focus on the technology’s effects rather than chase broad-based fears about the technology itself.

In the mid-19th century, British mathematician Charles Babbage conceptualized the first computer. The idea that God-given human reason could be replaced by a machine was fearfully received by Victorian England in a manner similar to today’s concern about machines being able to think like humans. In both instances, the angst, while intellectually interesting, proved to be overwrought. Babbage’s computer, detailed in hundreds of pages of precise schematics, was never fully constructed. Similarly, research to create human-like AI is not progressing with the feared apocalyptic pace. “We’ve pretty much stopped trying to mirror human thinking out of the box,” explains Andrew Moore, former dean of computer science at Carnegie-Mellon University.

At the forefront of history’s lessons for today’s technology challenges is the imperative to avoid substituting fear in place of solution-oriented thinking that asks questions, identifies issues, and seeks solutions. If thinking machines are not on the horizon to pose an existential threat, then how do we move beyond hysteria to focus on the practical effects of machine intelligence?

“At the forefront of history’s lessons for today’s technology challenges is the imperative to avoid substituting fear in place of solution-oriented thinking that asks questions, identifies issues, and seeks solutions.”

While the idea of artificial intelligence can be intimidating, in practical effect, machine learning is effectively coming to describe all of computer science. It is difficult to discover activity in the field of computer science that is outside of machine learning’s manipulation of data. Over a relatively condensed period, intelligent machines have moved from science fiction into our everyday lives. Importing the fears that confronted Babbage in the Victorian era does little to advance consideration of 21st-century policy decisions.

Elon Musk calls for “[r]egulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don’t do something foolish.” It is an idea validated by history. As the Industrial Revolution transformed the Western world’s economy and the lives of its citizens, it became apparent that the marketplace rules that had worked for agrarian mercantilism were no longer adequate for industrial capitalism. When the interests of the industrialists clashed with the broader public interest, the result was a new set of rules and regulations designed to mitigate the adverse effects resulting from the exploitation of the new technologies.

The call to similarly come to grips with AI is a legitimate effort. But it is a simple goal with complex components. The first response to such a suggestion is: “What AI are you talking about?” Is the suggestion to regulate AI weaponry? Or its impact on jobs? Is it AI’s impact on privacy? Or its ability to manipulate the competitive marketplace? Is it a suggestion to regulate the machines that drive AI? Or is it to control the activities of the people who create the AI algorithms?

The first step in any such oversight, therefore, is a clear delineation of the problems to be addressed. Regulating the technology itself is like regulating the wind: It blows to bend everything it touches but cannot be captured. Rather than the regulation of the amorphous mashup of technologies we refer to as artificial intelligence, we should focus on how to stormproof our dwellings and deal with the effects of the new technology.

A key lesson of history is that effective regulation focuses on prioritizing the effects of the new technology, rather than the ephemeral technology itself. The transformational nature of a new technology is not per se the primary technology itself, but rather the secondary effects enabled by that development. We didn’t regulate the railroad tracks and switches; we regulated the effects of their usage, such as rates and worker safety. We didn’t regulate the telegraph (and later telephone) wires and switches, but whether access to them was just and reasonable. History’s road map is clear: If there is to be meaningful regulation of AI, it should focus on the tangible effects of the technology.","October 31, 2019",Brookings Institution,race prejudice
